Becoming a delegate is a commitment to engage actively in the governance of the Optimism Collective for the benefit of the Collective\u2019s citizenry.</p>\\n<p>Although the exact roles and asks of a delegate will likely change over time, delegates are expected to shoulder the following key responsibilities:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Read, understand, and provide any necessary feedback on governance forum posts.</li>\\n<li>Think critically and give input on governance experiments that will define the future of the Collective.</li>\\n<li>Explore new ways to improve the Optimism Collective as a whole, whether by technical improvements, governance changes, or any other means.</li>\\n<li>Understand Optimism network parameters and how these parameters can be tuned to ensure that the core Optimism network functions optimally for all network participants.</li>\\n<li>Actively vote on governance proposals and explain the thinking behind each vote when helpful.</li>\\n<li>Promote the Collective\u2019s cultural values by setting a positive example for the general public.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h1>\\n<a name=\\"compensation-for-delegates-3\\" class=\\"anchor\\" href=\\"#compensation-for-delegates-3\\"></a>Compensation for delegates</h1>\\n<p>Acting as a delegate is expected to be a significant amount of effort and should be treated as a serious commitment. Just as the Optimism Collective aims to fairly and adequately reward the creation of public goods, the Collective will aim to fairly and adequately reward its delegates. Delegates will eventually receive compensation for this significant time commitment once the role has stabilized.</p>\\n<h1>\\n<a name=\\"publishing-your-commitment-4\\" class=\\"anchor\\" href=\\"#publishing-your-commitment-4\\"></a>Publishing your Commitment</h1>\\n<p>If you\u2019d like to be presented to users for delegation on the OP Airdrop <span class=\\"hashtag\\">#1</span> claim website once it\u2019s live, reply to this forum thread using the following template.

We will see an adaptive, flowing, and always changing code, guarded by a new collective. We live in constant change, the constitution needs to be born, live, die, and decompose to nurture the next constitution. In 4 years a new constitution will be set for the next 4 years and so on. When society makes 2 steps ahead usually also tends to consolidate power, which leads to stagnation and crisis. In a futile attempt to maintain the consolidated power usually those in power take society 1 step backward.

It has been a delight watching the community form and the network grow across every metric. As a delegate, I promise to represent fellow Optimism builders, users, and believers in Ethereum. I tell pretty much whoever will listen that rollups are broadband for blockchains and that they will change the world. As a delegate, I can help make this a reality and play a small role in scaling Ethereum to the masses.</p>\\n<p><strong>My view on the</strong> Optimistic Vision:<br>\\nThe most important line in the vision is, \u201cThe Optimism Collective will dispel the myth that <strong>public goods</strong> cannot be <strong>profitable</strong> .\u201d</p>\\n<p>Hindsight is 20/20, and for the first time, we can use it to our advantage to allocate capital (and potentially other resources) to public goods! When I first learned about public goods theory in an Economics class, the professor spoke of their unprofitably and underfunded nature as a given. I want the Collective to prove them wrong!</p>\\n<p>I think RPGF presents a new paradigm for human coordination. Today it directs funding to web3 devs who built useful tools, but tomorrow it can and will do so much more.</p>\\n<p><strong>My view</strong> <strong>on the first three articles of the</strong> Working Constitution:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>The transitory nature is good. In four years we will have a MUCH better idea of what effective governance looks like for crypto networks. I have always encouraged L2s to experiment (previously in development but now in governance) and am happy there is a commitment to it.</li>\\n<li>This is ambitious but I have nothing but praise. I am genuinely excited for the first Holder vs. Citizen conflict and think the Collective will come out of it stronger.</li>\\n<li>In my view this early level of control is necessary. I only ask that the Foundation maintain a rigorous internal process for treasury allocation and publish some sort of regular transparency report. I do not think the Foundation should ever be arbitrarily forced to dissolve. It should remain a steward and driving force for ecosystem growth and will naturally be made redundant by other actors.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>My Web3 interests:</strong><br>\\nDeFi, Privacy, Writing, Gaming</p>\\n<p><strong>Languages I speak and write:</strong> en</p>\\n<p><strong>My skills and areas of expertise:</strong><br>\\nI know DEX market structure and rollup economics very well<br>\\nI am also an avid researcher and a good recruiter</p>\\n<p><strong>My favorite Web3 projects:</strong><br>\\nRubicon (i am biased), Flashbots, Etherscan</p>","post_number":8,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2022-05-04T20:04:11.586Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":31,"reads":122,"readers_count":121,"score":314.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":235,"topic_slug":"delegate-commitments","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"https://www.tally.xyz/voter/profile/1E0WZ1","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"Tally | 1E0WZ1","clicks":3}],"read":true,"user_title":"","bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[{"id":2,"count":7,"can_act":true}],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":165,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"user_created_at":"2022-05-03T19:13:28.823Z","user_date_of_birth":null,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":580,"name":"Lefteris Karapetsas","username":"lefterisjp","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/lefterisjp/{size}/125_2.png","created_at":"2022-05-04T20:37:29.474Z","cooked":"<p><strong>Name</strong> : Lefteris Karapetsas</p>\\n<p><strong>Address or ENS:</strong> lefteris.eth</p>\\n<p><strong>Discord username</strong> : lefterisjp | Rotki#7253</p>\\n<p><strong>Verification</strong> (Tally profile or tweet): <a href=\\"https://www.tally.xyz/voter/profile/Y66G8Y\\" class=\\"inline-onebox\\" rel=\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\">Tally | Y66G8Y</a></p>\\n<p><strong>I have read and understood the Delegate Commitment Process:</strong> Yes</p>\\n<p><strong>I understand that becoming a delegate is a significant commitment:</strong> Yes</p>\\n<p><strong>My reasons for wanting to be a delegate:</strong> I have considerable experience on DAO governance, being an active delegate in 2 of the biggest DAOs (gitcoin and ENS) and I want to use that to help the Collective towards its goals of proving that public goods can be be profitable and something more people should work on.

(1) Makes sense. Things will evolve. (2) Intrigued to see how the bicameral governance of checks and balances will end up working out.

Thats similar to the set up of ENS, but at the same time, I\u2019m a little sad to see it cause I remember when OP launched, it was a B-corp and honestly I was really hoping they found a repeatable way for a B-corp to tokenize with delegated governance! Expectations are the root of all disappointment. I haven\u2019t read the charter for the foundation (couldn\u2019t find it), but hopefully its board is beholden to the decision of the governance system, otherwise the governance will be a farce, and the board are a shadow third check not stated in the design (just being real here).</p>\\n<p>Really excited to have methods to tune parameters as a delegate, I hope we have some cool dashboards to play with and take some lessons learned from other projects that do similar like mstable, TEC, 1inch, etc.</p>\\n<h2>\\n<a name=\\"my-web3-interests-5\\" class=\\"anchor\\" href=\\"#my-web3-interests-5\\"></a>My Web3 interests:</h2>\\n<p>DAOs, Economics, Governance, Identity, Social impact</p>\\n<h2>\\n<a name=\\"languages-i-speak-and-write-6\\" class=\\"anchor\\" href=\\"#languages-i-speak-and-write-6\\"></a><strong>Languages I speak and write:</strong>\\n</h2>\\n<p>English and a little Spanish</p>\\n<h2>\\n<a name=\\"my-skills-and-areas-of-expertise-7\\" class=\\"anchor\\" href=\\"#my-skills-and-areas-of-expertise-7\\"></a><strong>My skills and areas of expertise:</strong>\\n</h2>\\n<p>I\u2019ve been a contributing member of the Ethereum community since 2015 &amp; received a masters degree in Digital Currency in 2016 (first degree of any kind ever given in digital currencies).</p>\\n<p>As community manager for Slock.it and TheDAO, I helped form the community around TheDAO and led every angle of the crisis response effort following TheDAO Hack.</p>\\n<p>I co-founded the White Hat Group, which secured the at-risk funds (10% of the total supply of ETH) during TheDAO hack and one year later rescued $210 million dollars worth of crypto assets following the Parity Multisig Hack.

We\u2019ve worked with projects like Compound, dYdX, and Uniswap on several high-impact initiatives (e.g., DeFi Education Fund, running an auction process to hire an auditor for Compound, and the dYdX Grants Program. As part of our work, Reverie is an active voter in the governance processes of projects we\u2019re involved with. We believe great projects need great governance. Our motivation to be a delegate is simple: we care about governance, are excited about Optimism, and as a result, want to be involved in the governance process!</p>\\n<p><strong>My view on the Optimistic Vision 11:</strong> For better or worse, the easiest way to get great people to do great things in a capitalist system is to pay them. As a general matter, we\u2019re very aligned with the idea that (i) money is a thing that can be used to get great people to do great stuff, (ii) the more money (profits) you have, the more great people you can get and the more great stuff you can do, and (iii) public goods can generate a profit, and that profit can be re-invested into more public goods (read: great people). It won\u2019t all be rosy (there are plenty of private, rent-seeking actors masquerading as public goods entities), but with the right people sitting at the \u201cprofit allocation table,\u201d we believe the goal is an achievable one.</p>\\n<p><strong>My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:</strong> We think it\u2019s fair to say we don\u2019t know exactly what Optimism will look like in three to five years. As a result, we don\u2019t think it makes sense to have rigid rules around governance \u2014 a rigid constitution around a fluid and emergent technology/community would significantly slow the growth of the ecosystem.

We see Optimism governance as a bold step for the L2 space, governance structures, and Ethereum as a whole - we hope to contribute greatly to the conversation.</p>\\n<p><strong>Our view on the Optimistic Vision:</strong> Blockchain at Berkeley, as a non-profit, student organization focused on onboarding individuals into the crypto space through a technical-first value driven approach, supports the Optimistic Vision. We see the failure of our market to reward individuals based on collective impact, which we want to steer the Web3 community away from. Furthermore, we see the need for the Web3 space to scale in terms of values. The crypto space emerged due to philosophical ideals of anonymity and decentralization, and has grown to value composability, forming communities, and defining ownership. We want to see these values strengthened throughout the space, and the Optimistic Vision aligns with this by supporting public good projects that reward impact.</p>\\n<p><strong>Our view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:</strong></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>We are confident in the OP collective\u2019s ability and determination to define itself. We are committed to pushing the boundaries and being experimental with OP governance for the goal of developing a well informed permanent constitution when the collective is mature. We see the need for a more rigid structure overtime - but hope to contribute greatly to the collective\u2019s experimental years of self-determination.</li>\\n<li>We believe OP\u2019s bi-cameral system will be the force that ensures positive impact is profitable. Simple fungible token governance can create unhealthy dynamics - decisions made based on token price, consolidation of voting power, buying votes for selfish reasons, etc. Onboarding citizens who care about the success of the protocol - and not attaching a price tag to their vote - will help defend against these trends we have seen play out in other protocols. The dynamic between $OP holders and OP Citizens will create a system of checks and balances that we believe will be equilibrium of digital governance.</li>\\n<li>We view progressive decentralization as a necessity in our space - and we are grateful the Optimism Foundation will oversee stewardship of the Collective in its youth. We trust as the Collective matures and decentralizes its voting power, control over Optimism will be handed over.

We\u2019re currently a group of over 100 members, with a core unit focused exclusively on contributing to protocols in the form of governance, development, and white-hat.</p>\\n<p>As a student-run club, we take decentralized governance very seriously and think of ways to be a crypto-native as possible. Via our governance team, we\u2019re piloting an internal governance token, built on Polygon, which is an attempt to provide our club members and university students globally with a chance to learn, and contribute to our own club and manage our treasury and consequently fund public goods that contribute to the club such as educational courses, events, hackathons, outside development, white-hat, etc. By actively contributing to the club mission, members earn the erc-20 governance token, which gives club members voting authority on the treasury allocation and more. One of our main focus areas (both in research teams and in practice via our development team) has been projects such as Gitcoin. We are excited to further this interest by contributing to the OP Ecosystem both from a policy perspective and a technical one.</p>\\n<p>Our (planned) Optimism governance committee is composed of 2 Cryptography PhD Students (focused on rollup technologies), The 3 other students major in Computer Science, Economics, Sociology and International Relations. The governance committee works very closely with the research team to analyze emerging trends in DAOs and tokenomics. We are also advised by Prof. Matthew Green, Ph.D. (part of the founding team of Zcash) and Prof. Jim Liew (Prof of Finance and Cryptocurrencies)</p>\\n<p>It is imperative that in order for the Collective to be equitable and democratic, it needs to be inhabited by people from a diverse background that possess general proficiency about the strengths and limitations of web3 technologies and have the passion and drive to actually participate in the governance process. We believe that \u2013 for reasons we already elucidated \u2013 our student body is fit to advance the Collective to that direction.</p>\\n<p><strong>My view on the [Optimistic Vision]</strong></p>\\n<p>First and foremost, we love OP\u2019s idea of retroactive incentives. While retroactive incentives with clear and definite deployment are rare in a worldly context, in the context of the information age, we agree that retroactive incentives can be implemented fairly, using blockchain and other web3 technologies.</p>\\n<p>We also believe that the Collective is well-equipped to accomplish this task of deploying capital for public goods, in an ideal democracy. That\u2019s why a lot of us got into blockchains \u2013 To participate in a more perfect meritocracy with impact aligned profit.</p>\\n<p><strong>My view on the first three articles of the <a href=\\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55/1\\">Working Constitution</a>:</strong></p>\\n<p>We are encouraged by the nature of the Constitution being elastic. As we were piloting our token, one of the most important things we had to do is iteratively work on not only the guiding principles but also the tokenomics and implementation of agreed-upon proposals. As OP\u2019s collectively growing, we think it\u2019s important to be flexible.</p>\\n<p>The bicameral structure of OP\u2019s governance is one of the most interesting experiments in the blockchain governance space to date. Assuming that there is a proper accountability practice in place, adding an additional \u2018house\u2019 that isn\u2019t bound by the market condition of the governance token is surely going to align with the longer term goal of the Collective.

Then in quick succession (not sure which was first) I read a Bankless article on Moloch (and then the Slate Star Codex article that it references) and the book Ministry for The Future, in which one of the key components in saving the biosphere from global warming is a complete overhaul of the financial world through a crypto currency called Carbon Coin. Great book, go read it.</p>\\n<p>From that point on this idea that Ethereum was just an interesting tech project to learn about or a valuable investment seemed almost quaint. I\u2019ve been enthralled by projects like Gitcoin, Klima, and now Optimism. The concept of Ethereum\u2019s Phoenix, using the incentive structures of retroactive public goods funding to encourage behaviours with positive externalities seems completely revolutionary, it might well be what we need to overcome the Great Filter of climate change that we are barreling towards, and even if it\u2019s not then it will almost certainly be the Schelling point around which the people who do develop even better mechanisms converge. I want to be as involved as I can.</p>\\n<p><strong>My view on the</strong> <a href=\\"https://www.optimism.io/vision\\" rel=\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\">Optimistic Vision </a>: We have seen in the legacy world that relying on charity and altruism is not sufficient to tackle the biggest problems we face as a species. By flipping the incentives to reward actions that contribute to public goods the Optimistic Vision changes the game from one where freeloading and exploiting the commons benefits the individual more than the shared community cost effects them, to a system where finding the ways to produce the most positive effect with your capital will end up being the most financially rewarding choice.</p>\\n<p>Starting with public goods in Optimism and the broader Ethereum ecosystem is like ensuring your own oxygen mask and your family\u2019s are fitted first when an aircraft cabin loses pressure. In the long run though, my optimistic view is that we get to the cabin and take over from the unconscious pilot in time to avoid crashing to a fiery doom.</p>\\n<p><strong>My view</strong> <strong>on the first three articles of the</strong> <a href=\\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55/1\\">Working Constitution</a>: Articles 1 and 3 seem almost obvious at this stage of the collective. The first for exactly the reasons described in the constitution document itself and the third as a necessity for any governance organization in it\u2019s infancy. It is entirely understandable that the roles taken on by the Foundation are not feasible to be managed by the Token and Citizen houses initially. It seems unlikely that the undefined \u2018Take other actions that are conducive to its stewardship role\u2019 will be exploited to, for example, buy Ben Jones a yacht\u2026!</p>\\n<p>Article 2 is or course the most exciting part of the Optimism Collective\u2019s Working Constitution. I am extremely interested to see how the creation of Citizens will take place and how Sybil resistance will be maintained, however the idea of having part of the governance control based on permanent members with long term incentives, rather than having all the power effectively purchasable through token trading is very appealing. I think that it is becoming increasingly well recognized that airdropped token governance is inadequate on it\u2019s own. It is good to reward active participants in a project, but when many (most) airdrops get sold and governance power is then available to whoever can pay for it it is inevitable that we will recreate the plutocracy of the legacy world. By balancing this with OP citizens, issued with a single soulbound voting token the possibility for long term decision making seems much improved.</p>\\n<p><strong>My Web3 interests:</strong><br>\\n<em>Choose \u2264 five from the following set.

This digital space is moving quite fast, from Vitalik\u2019s whitepaper in 2013 to roll-ups and zkp in just 8 year, we have come a long way, from Bitcoin P2P idea to smart contract to metaverse to digital identity but we don\u2019t see any impact of this movement in physical world.

I submit that a better framing might be to consider public goods as goods that <a href=\\"https://scott.mirror.xyz/7nKKV4x17rVkZL9_C0vVL3Vax2rv1H1ciigleEgBAOw\\" rel=\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\"><em>create positive externalities</em></a>. In that framing, we can find plenty of examples of projects in Ethereum, including many DAOs, that are critical for the long term sustainability of web3. These projects should be financially rewarded such that they can not only survive, but thrive, and we now have new coordination and incentive mechanisms to ensure that happens in a way that benefits all market participants. In short, I believe in the optimistic vision for the same reason I believe in playing positive-sum games.</p>\\n<p><strong>My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>1. \\"This is a \u201cWorking\u201d Constitution\\"</strong></p>\\n<p>Good governance means working flexibly and adjusting direction not only based on the will of the community but based on learnings that naturally happen as a DAO scales. Huge fan of this approach and especially a fan of the four year limit. Consensus &gt; immutability.</p>\\n<p><strong>2. \\"OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective.\\"</strong></p>\\n<p>Love the idea of checks and balances across different decision-making bodies, and strongly agree with Vitalik <a href=\\"https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1519012381581463552\\" rel=\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\">here</a>. Although DAO governance is a powerful tool, we need to be careful, just in other democratic systems, to avoid implicit or explicit plutocracy.</p>\\n<p><strong>3. \\"The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model.\\"</strong></p>\\n<p>I strongly agree with the idea of progressive decentralization and believe it\u2019s only natural for Optimism to focus in on the foundation to start and slowly expand its values and goals out to the community. A DAO without direction cannot achieve its goals, and there needs to be a core group that sets the initial conditions for future direction / growth.</p>\\n<p><strong>My Web3 interests:</strong></p>\\n<p>DAOs, governance, economics, social impact, privacy</p>\\n<p><strong>Languages I speak and write:</strong></p>\\n<p>English, French</p>\\n<p><strong>My skills and areas of expertise:</strong></p>\\n<p>partnerships, governance design, economic modeling, community building</p>\\n<p><strong>My favorite Web3 projects:</strong></p>\\n<p>Gitcoin, Optimism, ENS</p>\\n<p>Let\u2019s create a positive-sum world.</p>","post_number":33,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2022-05-09T13:51:03.715Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":19,"reads":94,"readers_count":93,"score":172.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":235,"topic_slug":"delegate-commitments","display_username":"Scott Moore","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1519012381581463552","internal":false,"reflection":false,"clicks":1},{"url":"https://scott.mirror.xyz/7nKKV4x17rVkZL9_C0vVL3Vax2rv1H1ciigleEgBAOw","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"It\'s Time to Build (For the Public Good) \u2014 Scott Moore","clicks":0}],"read":true,"user_title":"","bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[{"id":2,"count":4,"can_act":true}],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":250,"hidden":false,"trust_level":0,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"user_created_at":"2022-05-06T01:40:47.693Z","user_date_of_birth":null,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":836,"name":"GFX Labs","username":"GFXlabs","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/gfxlabs/{size}/171_2.png","created_at":"2022-05-09T21:54:19.122Z","cooked":"<p>Optimism Delegate Application</p>\\n<p><strong>Name</strong>: GFX Labs</p>\\n<p><strong>Address or ENS:</strong> gfxlabs.eth</p>\\n<p><strong>Twitter Handle</strong> <a href=\\"https://twitter.com/labsGFX\\" rel=\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\">@labsGFX</a></p>\\n<p><strong>Verification</strong> (Tally profile or tweet): <a href=\\"https://www.tally.xyz/voter/0xa6e8772af29b29B9202a073f8E36f447689BEef6/governance/eip155:1:0x408ED6354d4973f66138C91495F2f2FCbd8724C3\\" rel=\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\">GFX Labs Tally Profile</a></p>\\n<p><strong>I have read and understood the Delegate Commitment Process:</strong> Yes.</p>\\n<p><strong>I understand that becoming a delegate is a significant commitment:</strong> Yes.</p>\\n<p><strong>My reasons for wanting to be a delegate:</strong> We look forward to leveraging our learnings from other protocols and the deep relationships our team has fostered across DeFi, TradFi, governments, and academics.</p>\\n<p>GFX has a record of rolling up our sleeves and getting work done. The GFX team has authored half of all successful proposals on Uniswap (including the first cross-chain governance proposal), listed multiple assets and developed the price oracle on Compound, and led efforts at MakerDAO to interface with regulators, lawmakers, and outside researchers. We actively work to find mutual benefits for protocols we cover to collaborate \u2013 such as the soon-to-be deployed DAI Direct Deposit Module for MakerDAO to plug directly into Compound.</p>\\n<p>Delegation to GFX Labs is a delegation to a governance team that is one of the most experienced in DeFi, able to facilitate partnerships, and with a track record of consistent engagement and delivery of results.</p>\\n<p><strong>GFX Labs isn\u2019t a fund. We don\u2019t hold positions. We are a team of builders who love DeFi.</strong> Our participation in governance is rooted in a desire to see DeFi overtake legacy finance. We promise to be active participants. We\u2019ll explain not only when we agree, but most importantly, when we disagree. As first-hand participants in governance, we know how frustrating it is to work on a proposal, receive limited comments, only to have the proposal shot down at launch. Our door will always be open to those who share the passion for DeFi that we have.</p>\\n<p><strong>My view on the</strong> Optimistic Vision: GFX has a passion for building and optimizing protocols and the Web3 ecosystem generally. Our past record shows a commitment to the same ideals expressed in the Optimistic Vision \u2013 collaboration, coordination, and democratization of everything Web3.</p>\\n<p><strong>My view</strong> <strong>on the first three articles of the</strong> Working Constitution:<br>\\nArticle 1: Experimentation is appropriate, but past experience at major protocols suggests experimentation should be done with specific goals in mind. An ability to experiment early on is worthwhile, but needs to be tempered with an ability to commit once a winning formula has been found.</p>\\n<p>Article 2: A bicameral structure should in theory provide a more robust set of checks and balances, but only to the extent that OP Holder and OP Citizens are representative of differing constituencies. Shaping the criteria for the latter will be very important to get correct.</p>\\n<p>Article 3: The Foundation-that-decentralizes-over-time model worked quite well for governing the Maker protocol. It will be important to have robust governance processes developed prior to the end of that journey, however, to insure institutional knowledge is retained and best practices continue after full decentralization.</p>\\n<p><strong>My Web3 interests:</strong><br>\\n<em>Choose \u2264 five from the following set.

Lack of public goods funding in the physical world often perpetuates inequalities, especially for underrepresented members of society. We align wholeheartedly with the statement that public goods can in fact be profitable, because democratizing access to resources has ripple effects in reducing inequality and as a result, generating profit. We aim to represent our communities of allies and underrepresented folks of crypto and believe we can assist the Collective in this goal. We would welcome the opportunity to contribute and play a directional role in building a virtuous cycle of impact driven expansion which benefits all users of the ecosystem (both existing and potential) both financially and via user experience which aligns closely she256\u2019s core mission.</p>\\n<p><strong>My view</strong> <strong>on the first three articles of the Working Constitution</strong>:</p>\\n<p>As we fundamentally believe in blockchain technology shaping our future governance structures, we support the Working Constitution\u2019s commitment to experimentation and flexibility and would welcome the opportunity to play an active role in building the playbook for fair, democratic decentralized governance. Impossible to master on the first try, governance requires commitment to rapid experimentation / adaptation ensures a healthy system where incentives remain aligned.</p>\\n<p>We support the Optimism\u2019s model to move away from simple token-based governance systems which tend towards consolidated power amongst the wealthy \u201cwhales\u201d of our ecosystem. This experiment to build a voting system representative of a large diverse community, regardless of token balance, aligns closely with she256\u2019s core mission. As the Optimism Collective continues to experiment with governance structures, we welcome the opportunity to help hold the Collective accountable in avoiding excessive consolidation of power and aligning incentives for all members of our society as this is a key component of our voting philosophy.</p>\\n<p>We believe in progressive decentralization and welcome the Optimism Foundation as early leaders in the Optimism Collective\u2019s governance model. We request the transparency in actions and decision-making of the Foundation and look forward to the guidance and unique insight that the Foundation can provide.</p>\\n<p>Zooming out, we believe the ability to clearly and concisely communicate information, as done in the Working Constitution itself, is a healthy indication of well-organized and sustainable governance.</p>\\n<p><strong>My skills and areas of expertise:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Have been in the space since early 2018, and were the first-ever 501c3 created to tackle the diversity issue in web3.</li>\\n<li>We have onboarded 1000s of women, and other underrepresented minorities to this space through a combination of educational content, mentorship initiatives, and community-building.

For us, blockchain governance and DAOs are the perfect infrastructure for the diverse communities that will be formed this century. Over the last few years, we\u2019ve worked hard to support that diversity. We\u2019ve added support for different voting systems (quadratic, weighted, ranked-choice,\u2026), strategies that allow DAOs to attribute voting power to NFTs, POAPs, ERC-1155, or any kind of tokens. A well-designed DAO thrives when its community thrives and vice-versa. We want to participate in this experiment and help design an infrastructure that rewards public goods because we know from first-hand experience how tough it is to build them.</p>\\n<p><strong>My view on the Optimistic Vision</strong>: We\u2019d like to discuss here three key ideas found in the interpretation section of the Working Constitution, as these guiding principles are key to the Optimistic Vision. First, we fully agree with the necessity of minimizing governance. I think a better framework to use here is to clearly define the tasks and decisions pertinent to each level of the Optimism governance structure. Avoiding governance fatigue means only bringing the most important decisions to the community. For this reason, we fully support the delegate system.</p>\\n<p>Second, fixing the current plutocratic state of governance is trickier than it seems. There is a clear gap between the current dominant idea that token voting sucks and the reality of blockchain governance where an immense majority of projects still use token voting. Achieving a balance between financial stake and humanhood is a complex issue, but we strongly believe that the Optimism Collective has one of the best chances at solving this issue - which is why we\u2019re applying to be delegates.</p>\\n<p>Finally, we strongly believe in the necessity of funding public goods. For the first year of its existence, Snapshot survived from donations - Gitcoin, and a few generous projects such as Balancer or Curve. If it wasn\u2019t for their generosity, Snapshot wouldn\u2019t exist today. During that time, most of the biggest web3 projects were already using it. We are 100% committed to helping new public good projects grow and serve the ecosystem, and we strongly believe we\u2019ll benefit significantly from that cultural shift.</p>\\n<p><strong>My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution</strong>: Adding to what\u2019s written in the first article, it\u2019s necessary to innovate in terms of blockchain governance. The clock is ticking in terms of planet-wide coordination problems and the insights we can gain here have the power to change that. We have a moral duty to be pioneers of a system where looking out for one another is rewarded, and doesn\u2019t come at an economic cost.</p>\\n<p>In the second article, I\u2019d like to add that conflict is the default state of any democracy. Conflict is good, it\u2019s a sign that dialog is possible and encouraged. It should be fostered, and key to the economic and ethical health of the governance structure.</p>\\n<p>Finally, the third article is a necessary measure and we believe that, as the first article states, this is something we\u2019ll be able to discuss more in-depth once the Optimism Collective has found its footing and is ready to decentralize these responsibilities.</p>\\n<p><strong>My Web3 interests</strong>: DAOs, Governance, Infrastructure, Social Impact, Identity</p>\\n<p><strong>Languages I speak and write</strong>: Across the Snapshot team, you will find native speakers of English, French, German, Mandarin, Italian, Indonesian, Hindi, and many more.</p>\\n<p><strong>My skills and areas of expertise</strong>: Designing governance systems and implementing them.</p>\\n<p><strong>My favorite Web3 projects</strong>: Gitcoin, Balancer, Open Zeppelin</p>","post_number":50,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2022-05-18T20:10:44.837Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":19,"reads":54,"readers_count":53,"score":120.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":235,"topic_slug":"delegate-commitments","display_username":"Nathan VDH","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"https://twitter.com/NathanVDH0x/status/1525113233593491456","internal":false,"reflection":false,"clicks":3}],"read":false,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[{"id":2,"count":1,"can_act":true}],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":329,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"user_created_at":"2022-05-11T15:35:25.631Z","user_date_of_birth":null,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":1273,"name":"Daniele Salatti","username":"DanieleSalatti","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/danielesalatti/{size}/218_2.png","created_at":"2022-05-19T03:30:43.460Z","cooked":"<p><strong>Name</strong> : Daniele Salatti</p>\\n<p><strong>Address or ENS:</strong> salatti.eth (0x523d007855B3543797E0d3D462CB44B601274819)</p>\\n<p><strong>Discord username</strong> : DanieleSalatti#6258</p>\\n<p><strong>Verification</strong> (Tally profile or tweet):</p>\\n<p>Tally is having issues with address linking, so <a href=\\"https://twitter.com/DanieleSalatti/status/1527130170951360512\\" rel=\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\">here\u2019s the tweet</a>.</p>\\n<p>Profile, once linking is fixed is <a href=\\"https://www.tally.xyz/voter/profile/4VKVOY\\" class=\\"inline-onebox\\" rel=\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\">Tally | 4VKVOY</a></p>\\n<p><strong>I have read and understood the Delegate Commitment Process:</strong> Yes</p>\\n<p><strong>I understand that becoming a delegate is a significant commitment:</strong> Yes</p>\\n<p><strong>My reasons for wanting to be a delegate:</strong><br>\\nI want to be an active participant in a project that I believe can have a seriously net positive impact on society as a whole.

Alliance DAO is a community of builders that is focused on supporting Web3 founders individually and collectively succeed. Alliance believes that Optimism is building a foundation for Web3 projects that need the functionality of EVM without the gas intensity. Among many reasons for wanting to participate in Optimism\u2019s governance, three reasons motivate me to apply: (1) Optimism is building core infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem; (2) Optimism will be increasingly important for Alliance founders; and (3) Optimism will play an important role in helping DAOs govern increasingly large pools of capital. I believe that by directing capital to support public goods in the Optimism and Ethereum communities will generate significant value to these three causes.</p>\\n<p>We believe Optimism will provide long-term value to the Ethereum ecosystem. Optimism\u2019s focus on EVM equivalence and minimalism enable projects to access the core functions of Ethereum with high fidelity and low friction while reducing the gas intensity of operating directly on mainnet. The coming release of Bedrock represents the culmination of years of experience and trial-and-error that we believe will give developers even greater confidence to build on Optimism. Secure, battle-tested L2s are a gateway through which Web3 innovations will thrive.</p>\\n<p>Optimism is a scaling solution for a number of projects that have graduated from our accelerator, including Synthetix and Perpetual Protocol. We believe Optimism will be an L2 of choice for many future cohort participants, given the demand for EVM equivalence and the ease of integration via Optimism. I aim to represent the views of our founders and cohort companies who have a vested interest in Optimism\u2019s reliability and improvement.</p>\\n<p>I believe we are approaching a point where L2 solutions will be critical to DAO function, specifically. As we see more experimentation with governance, we need an EVM equivalent L2 that reduces the transaction cost of governance. Delegated hierarchies, subdaos, and pods present exciting opportunities to augment governance systems, but the pace and quality of experimentation will be suboptimal unless DAOs build governance on L2, thereby minimizing gas costs. Optimism is a prime candidate for enabling better governance for DAOs.</p>\\n<p>By participating in the governance of the Optimism Collective, I aim to be a steward of the mission to direct funding to public goods that benefit builders in the Ethereum and Optimism communities in furtherance of the three purposes I listed.</p>\\n<p><strong>My view on the</strong> <a href=\\"https://www.optimism.io/vision\\" rel=\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\">Optimistic Vision </a>: We believe that incentives drive outcomes. Web3 projects have created more tangible incentives for actions and relationships that were previously difficult to quantify. Optimism\u2019s view that impact=profit is an extension of our view that well-engineered, traceable incentives create optimal value for collective activities.</p>\\n<p>Ownership and rewards are the most reliable way to attract talented builders to address problems that affect the collective. While there are noble examples of altruists who create public goods, altruism is not reliably abundant, and it is most often an individual trait rather than a trait of teams. Web3 building requires focused teams, and ownership and rewards offer predictable incentives that can guide teams to increase the common good.</p>\\n<p>Optimism\u2019s vision touches on a matter of necessity. Web3 needs communities that strive to create incentives to build public goods. There are many Web3 participants who seek to extract rents and game systems for profit to the detriment of the community. Optimism\u2019s vision is a rallying point for capable builders to push against short-termism, thereby ensuring that over the long run, value will compound for the entire community.</p>\\n<p><strong>My view</strong> <strong>on the first three articles of the</strong> <a href=\\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55/1\\">Working Constitution</a>:</p>\\n<p><strong>Article 1:</strong> At Alliance, we emphasize that the greatest systems start simple. To create a rigid model of governance without the benefit of incremental feedback on specific governing rules is to govern in a vacuum. In my constant review of DAO governance systems, I see that the most successful communities adopt minimal procedural principles and adopt specific rules as specific needs arise.</p>\\n<p>I often speak with Alliance cohort companies of the importance of experimentation in improving governance throughout Web3. The results of the experiments need to be intelligible in order to provide appropriate feedback. If the results of governance experiments are documented and made broadly available, the record of the experiments are, themselves, public goods. Optimism and other DAOs can study each others\u2019 governance trials to consider how prospective rules could affect their own communities.</p>\\n<p>As we learn more about how rules function with specific communities, we need to permit those communities to adapt to their reality and adopt the rules that best suit them. For that reason, it is important that the Constitution is focused on flexibility. We should only adopt enough order to initiate a worthwhile experiment, while limiting the potential downsides of path dependence.</p>\\n<p>By virtue of the commitment to experimentation, it follows that the Constitution should be transitory at inception. We may discover sound methods of governing that are unimaginable to us at the moment, which would make dogmatic reference to the original document unproductive. An example of governance innovations that had no application in the recent past is Optimism\u2019s adoption of soulbound tokens for the Citizens House. We may discover incredible utility from using soulbound tokens that, had a governing document conflicted with the adoption of those tokens, would have stunted the development of the governance system.</p>\\n<p>The goal of creating a Bedrock Constitution is helpful: at some point governance history may require documentation of foundational rules. The Bedrock Constitution should incorporate the principle of flexibility and the capacity for amendment in order to sustain the spirit of innovation.</p>\\n<p><strong>Article 2</strong> : Basic token-weighted governance has not proven to work for collectives. I have studied DAOs that are purportedly flat in structure and repeatedly these DAOs show gulf in participation between a small number of repeat-participants and the mass of inactive participants. Without balance of power, a few actors grab power, which alienates most would-be contributors.</p>\\n<p>Optimism\u2019s bicameral structure is a compelling way to balance short term needs with long term, stable decision making. Variants of the bicameral model worked for Rome (Senate / Tribunes), Sparta (ephors / gerousia) and for many constitutional structures in modern government.</p>\\n<p>It is too early to assess whether the specific reserved powers for the Citizens\u2019 House and Token House will provide sufficient controls. Experimentation will provide feedback that will help inform which powers should be reserved to which house.</p>\\n<p><strong>Article 3:</strong> I am very familiar with Cayman Foundation Companies, as I have researched the option for Alliance DAO and for other DAOs. I believe that structures like the Cayman Foundation, which permit significant flexibility in organizational design, are a stepping stone, but not an end state, in building successful DAOs.</p>\\n<p>If the Optimism Foundation faithfully administers the vision of progressive decentralization, it will have fulfilled a critical function for the Optimism ecosystem. As drafted (presumably in the Memorandum of Association), the Board\u2019s powers present an additional dimension of separation of powers. The Foundation can have a stabilizing effect if the initial allocation of powers between the Citizens\u2019 House and Token House is not perfectly balanced. Over time, it should be made clear what powers the Citizens\u2019 House and Token House have relative to the Foundation and whether the Foundation will have the ultimate goal of sharing the power to amend the Constitution or ceding the power altogether.</p>\\n<p><strong>My Web3 interests:</strong><br>\\nDAOs, Governance, Legal, Economics, Writing</p>\\n<p><strong>Languages I speak and write:</strong><br>\\n<em>Please choose from the <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes\\" rel=\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\">ISO 639-1 </a> list</em> en</p>\\n<p><strong>My skills and areas of expertise:</strong> I was trained as a corporate governance attorney.

I\u2019ve been following this space for 8 years, and I\u2019ve yet to see an application that isn\u2019t deeply \u201cmeta\u201d.

We\u2019re a decentralised derivates exchange and one of the leading protocols that currently operates on Optimism. We\u2019re a big believer in composability and have been actively bringing partner projects over to deploy on OP. Having committed to making OP our home, we\u2019d love to be an $OP delegate to help shape the future of Optimism.</p>\\n<p><strong>My view on the</strong> <a href=\\"https://www.optimism.io/vision\\" rel=\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\">Optimistic Vision</a>:<br>\\nCompletely agree that we need to create a space that is owned by its citizens rather than a select few. The focus on composability excites us on the future of the space and it\u2019s something we can\u2019t wait to see play out</p>\\n<p><strong>My view on the first three articles of the</strong> <a href=\\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55/1\\">Working Constitution</a>:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<strong>This is a working constitution</strong> : Agree. This is a very similar approach that we take at Perp as we believe in the need to continually learn and improve.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective</strong> : Agree on this view. It\u2019s extremely important that we place emphasis on the balance - too often projects skew either side.</li>\\n<li>\\n<strong>The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model</strong> : We understand that there needs to be some entity to start with to help facilitate governance and push things forward.

StableNode also provides a full suite of services around governance with both implementation and active participation as a delegate.</p>\\n<p>The Governance Lab of the StableNode team is on a mission to provide decentralized governance best practices to ecosystems. There is no one-size-fits-all solution but a framework of principles and tools that articulate alternative paths based on each ecosystem\u2019s maturity level. Our primary focus is working with the community to develop this framework and continue to facilitate innovation within this domain.</p>\\n<p><strong>Our view on the Optimistic Vision:</strong></p>\\n<p>At StableNode, we believe that public funding is essential to developing a non-financial-driven web3. We believe that the focus should be on encouraging developers to take a different approach to web3 and focus more on public goods where a lot of development is made. Even though public goods are necessary to the space, there is a lack of funding, making it a less attractive role for developers.</p>\\n<p>Initially, the blockchain space was born out of a need to change the current financial and political standards that we have. The Optimistic vision details a necessary future and sets a new standard for public funding that is sustainable and will encourage new developers to focus on this field while not sacrificing the financial gain they would gain elsewhere.</p>\\n<p><strong>Our view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:</strong></p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>This is a \u201cWorking\u201d Constitution.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Currently, we are in the exploration stage of governance, and it is refreshing to see a protocol acknowledge this and encourage continuous experimentation throughout the next few years.</p>\\n<p>Decentralized governance is relatively a new field within Web3. It is an important topic that we need to continue working on. Many problems such as voting mechanisms, delegate incentives, and plutocracy need to be tackled. We believe that the best way to succeed is to practically try new governance methods in protocols and understand what is successful or detrimental to a protocols governance framework. The theory is essential, but it can only get you so far. We are excited to be a delegate for a protocol that prioritizes experimentation.</p>\\n<ol start=\\"2\\">\\n<li>OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>This experimentation hopes to tackle problems such as misaligned incentives through token holders or plutocracy. Such issues are prominent in the space and allow token holders to prioritize their financial gains over long-term improvement. With the citizen house maintaining control over the retroactive public funding it realigns incentives in a more fruitful manner.</p>\\n<p>Those individuals from the token house might be against public funding as this means reduced financial gains for themselves, but those from the citizen house who have no financial incentives for OP would want to see the space move forward and see those actors developing public goods be compensated fairly.</p>\\n<ol start=\\"3\\">\\n<li>The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>We favor the foundation initially leading the governance front while the framework and structure of the OP governance are being built. With token holders and delegates initially not having a financial incentive to contribute, it is most likely that progress would be slower without a foundation. Over time as the structure and framework are built, as mentioned in the working collective, it would be expected that the foundation would slowly release the responsibilities to the DAO.</p>\\n<p><strong>Our Web3 interests:</strong></p>\\n<p>DAOs, Data and analytics, DeFi, Governance, Social impact</p>\\n<p><strong>As a team, we speak the following languages:</strong></p>\\n<p>en, ko, da, de, es, zh</p>\\n<p><strong>Our skills and areas of expertise:</strong> Governance and Growth</p>\\n<p>We are currently delegates at Element Finance, InstadApp, MakerDAO, and others.</p>\\n<p><strong>What voters can expect from StableNode:</strong></p>\\n<p>We will use our expertise to import the most promising practices within governance to guide Optimism governance to a more sustainable approach.</p>\\n<p>We want to help facilitate discussions where we can identify the best practices and recognize how to tackle core problems within governance such as plutocracy, voter apathy, and lack of experimentation.</p>\\n<p>As delegates, we pursue:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Active participation in votes</li>\\n<li>Transparency for each vote</li>\\n<li>Open discussion and contribution to the DAO forum</li>\\n<li>Contribute to the innovation and development of governance frameworks</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Conflicts of Interest</strong></p>\\n<p>StableNode acts as delegates on other protocols.

Nothing would give me greater satisfaction that exposing this sort of behavior publicly so that righteous Eth values can prosper.

If delegates fall victim to group-think or are concerned about harmony rather than moral principles, I think this experiment will be a colossal failure.  Delegates must be willing to risk being very unpopular in order to do what is right, and without such delegates this is going to be a massive handout to anyone unscrupulous enough to exploit it and a constituency apathetic enough to allow it to happen.</p>\\n<p><strong>My view</strong> <strong>on the first three articles of the</strong> <a href=\\"https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55/1\\">Working Constitution</a>: Decentralized governance has yet to be solved, so I think a commitment to experimentation is warranted.

I also love to make the (somewhat flawed) comparison between blockchain ecosystems and new economies and think it\u2019s essential to find key parties early-on which are able to unlock network effects, a sustainable growth of the ecosystem - based on real economic growth - with aligned values (!).

We want to become Optimism delegates, because we believe Layer 2s, and specifically Optimism, are a core piece to scaling the new digital economy on top of Ethereum.</p>\\n<p>Flipside Governance participates in more than a dozen protocols across Ethereum, Solana, Algorand, Flow, and a number of Cosmos SDK chains. We work closely with Aave, SushiSwap, Marinade, and MakerDAO - and have on-chain proof of participation. We aim to bring our expertise and one of the few full-time Governance teams in the industry to help Optimism strengthen its governance and voting processes.</p>\\n<p>As a delegate, Optimism gains full access to our time and resources, a team of 70+ with robust data science &amp; infrastructure capabilities, and our community of 12,000+ data analysts.</p>\\n<p>On top of that, we will contribute hands-on expertise in voting, writing, and passing proposals. We are active community members in protocols that we engage with - you can find us actively participating on governance forums, Discord, and Twitter.</p>\\n<p><strong>Our view on the Optimistic Vision 42:</strong></p>\\n<p>Through our analytical bounty and scavenger programs, Flipside Crypto embodies the axiom <em><strong>impact=profit.</strong></em> Flipside Community members take the time and initiative to build out dashboards and analytics, providing unique insights for a range of protocols &amp; DAOs.</p>\\n<p>Flipside believes that public goods inform and empower the average crypto user better than closed source alternatives. Optimism is pioneering this vision and advocating for profitability at the same time. We want to help Optimism follow through on its vision and improve Web3 accountability, one build at a time.</p>\\n<p><strong>Our view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:</strong></p>\\n<p><em>Article 1</em>: Every DAO experiences different Growth trajectories. As partners of DAOs in different stages of maturity and TVL, we believe it is important to allow for flexibility while building with speed. Enough structure to support, as much freedom as possible, is our guiding principle.</p>\\n<p><em>Article 2:</em> While token holders are entitled to certain rights, they are not what makes up a DAO by themselves - Governance comes in many forms and is in need of innovation. Optimism must find a balance between value creation and encouraging participation among community members. We acknowledge multiple assets exist to make up a DAO and are excited by the experimental use of emerging new mechanisms, like \u201csoulbound\u201d NFTs.</p>\\n<p><em>Article 3:</em> As Compound has shown, and as we have seen in our work with MakerDAO, there is a way for organizations to become more decentralized over time. We believe that having the Optimism Foundation as a steward in the early stages of development is instrumental, as the Foundation can provide the insight and knowledge necessary for building a strong product that can then enable successful decentralization.</p>\\n<p><strong>Our Web3 interests:</strong></p>\\n<p>Data Analytics, Bounty &amp; Grants Programs, Layer 1s &amp; Layer 2s, Governance, and DAOs (see <a href=\\"https://metricsdao.xyz/\\" rel=\\"noopener nofollow ugc\\">MetricsDAO</a>)</p>\\n<p><strong>Languages we speak and write:</strong></p>\\n<p>Our core governance team is composed of members who are fluent in English, German, and Mandarin.</p>\\n<p><strong>Our skills and areas of expertise:</strong></p>\\n<p>Flipside is a Web3 company with experience in building tools, communities, and recently DAOs. We partner with major networks &amp; protocols to drive data analytics and user acquisition.</p>\\n<p>Flipside Governance, a department of Flipside Crypto, was established in September 2021, to directly support and contribute to DAO governance, and increase participation in our partner communities - thereby helping to improve the efficiency of this critical piece of protocol health.</p>\\n<p>We are committed to using this team and experience to improve DAOs one proposal at a time.</p>\\n<p>Flipside Governance is one of the few full-time governance teams in the industry.
