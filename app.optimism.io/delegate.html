My view on the Optimistic Vision: I align strongly with the vision. I’m excited about the new model focused on optimizing for positive impact and providing retroactive incentives for public goods.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Agree, I think the collective should be open to experimentation and be dynamic in the early days as we grow and learn&lt;br&gt;
Agree, I’m supportive of checks and balances&lt;br&gt;
Agree, I’m glad to see the Optimism Foundation be a steward of the collective early on&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

My skills and areas of expertise: product (previously product manager at Coinbase), governance (delegate for Gitcoin and Element DAO), writing / creating educational content, operations, strategy, DeFi (advisor of 0x and investor in many DeFi projects), investing (co-founder of crypto fund Scalar Capital)</p></div><div class="delegateCard__container "><div class="delegateCard__header"><img alt="user icon" class="icon" src="https://gov.optimism.io/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/web3mark/90/346_2.png"><div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;"><h3>Quixotic (Optimism NFT Marketplace)</h3><p class="delegateCard__description">0xB1EA...8251</p></div></div><p class="delegateCard__description">Quixotic is the first and largest NFT marketplace on Optimism. In addition to building the marketplace, we spend lots of time building community and advising projects in the Optimism NFT space. NFTs have a small marketshare compared to defi, but a large mindshare. We believe NFTs will be crucial to defining the culture of Optimism and for any governance proposal someone should be asking: “how does this affect NFTs and non-financial dapps?” We plan to advocate for the interest of NFT projects and non-financial dapps during the governance process.

My view on the Optimistic Vision:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the words of Vitalik, “even a billion dollars of capital cannot compete with a project having a soul.” The Optimistic Vision is the soul of Optimism, which is to say it’s the most important part of this project. If we succeed in moving the majority of layer 1 Ethereum activity to layer 2s like Optimism, the vision and values of the protocol will be enormously important. We’re strongly committed to creating a world of regenerative finance, positive externalities, and shared abundance.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We agree that taking an iterative approach is best and that there will be more rapid iteration at earlier stages than later stages.
The token house makes a lot of sense. Questions remain around the Citizen’s house: How is citizenship allocated? Can someone lose citizenship? What will incentivize citizens to actually participate in governance?
We feel confident that the OF will govern with a steady hand and is committed to progressive decentralization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


My skills and areas of expertise: NFTs, web3 community, non-financial dapps
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The SNX Ambassadors play the role of governance participation on behalf of our community for many protocols and Optimism governance would be yet another key place for us to be active in.

My view on the Optimistic Vision :
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The OP collective will be a new path for governance in Cyberspace, and the physical world.
Ownership and rewards are the most reliable way to attract the best builders to address problems that affect the collective
Web3 needs groups that want to create incentives to build public goods; OP vision is a rallying point for builders to push against short termism. This will ensure value will compound for the long run.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is a “working” constitution:
We live in constant change, and this transitory document needs to reflect our human behavior/lifestyle to be fluid until we create our “bedrock” framework.
Innovation is needed for blockchain governance&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective:
Short-term incentives and long term visions must be aligned; we are excited about the experimentation between OP Governance and OP citizenship.
Variants of the bicameral model worked for Sparta, and has alot of potential on what OP is proposing&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model:
We believe in progressive decentralization and welcome the OP Foundation as early leaders in the OP Collectives governance model.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

My skills and areas of expertise: The Synthetix Ambassador Council is comprised of three members who are signers on the snxambassador.eth multi-sig and we oversee governance for many ecosystem protocols. We are currently active Delegates for several DeFi projects and have experience in submitting and deploying governance proposals and staying up to date on broader governance matters. We also have access to resources with in the Synthetix DAO for purposes of protocol integrations.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Our current signers, who’s twitter handles can be found on @snxambassadors profile bio, are made up of a combination of SNX Core Contributors and long time active Community members who are well versed in the operation of Synthetix and other DeFi/NFT projects.
We have a diverse set of skills that include Protocol/Governance analysis, user acquisition strategies, varying degrees of DeFi integrations, general marketing/communication skills and a wide range of other abilities in web3 and DeFi alike.

The GFX team has authored half of all successful proposals on Uniswap (including the first cross-chain governance proposal), listed multiple assets and developed the price oracle on Compound, and led efforts at MakerDAO to interface with regulators, lawmakers, and outside researchers. We actively work to find mutual benefits for protocols we cover to collaborate – such as the soon-to-be deployed DAI Direct Deposit Module for MakerDAO to plug directly into Compound.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Delegation to GFX Labs is a delegation to a governance team that is one of the most experienced in DeFi, able to facilitate partnerships, and with a track record of consistent engagement and delivery of results.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

GFX Labs isn’t a fund. We don’t hold positions. We are a team of builders who love DeFi. Our participation in governance is rooted in a desire to see DeFi overtake legacy finance. We promise to be active participants. We’ll explain not only when we agree, but most importantly, when we disagree. As first-hand participants in governance, we know how frustrating it is to work on a proposal, receive limited comments, only to have the proposal shot down at launch. Our door will always be open to those who share the passion for DeFi that we have.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

My view on the Optimistic Vision: GFX has a passion for building and optimizing protocols and the Web3 ecosystem generally. Our past record shows a commitment to the same ideals expressed in the Optimistic Vision – collaboration, coordination, and democratization of everything Web3.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Article 1: Experimentation is appropriate, but past experience at major protocols suggests experimentation should be done with specific goals in mind. An ability to experiment early on is worthwhile, but needs to be tempered with an ability to commit once a winning formula has been found.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Article 2: A bicameral structure should in theory provide a more robust set of checks and balances, but only to the extent that OP Holder and OP Citizens are representative of differing constituencies. Shaping the criteria for the latter will be very important to get correct.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Article 3: The Foundation-that-decentralizes-over-time model worked quite well for governing the Maker protocol. It will be important to have robust governance processes developed prior to the end of that journey, however, to insure institutional knowledge is retained and best practices continue after full decentralization.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Wish I could offer you some grand statement, but it’s just curiosity at this point.


My view on the Optimistic Vision: Well, it’s curiosity and also a novel vision. I despise the entirely plutocratic systems that pervade the crypto space (a large reason why I’m a crypto-skeptic), and any attempt at breaking beyond it is worth contributing to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:

1. This is pretty obvious - you wouldn’t have governance if the constitution wasn’t a work-in-progress.

2. Finding a balance will be challenging, I believe more specific goals and targets need to be fleshed out by citizens and holders and embedded into the constitution.

3. Also a pragmatic way to begin, though I’d like to see Optimism Foundation’s influence gradually diminish over time.

But really, I’ve spent the last 5 years putting my heart and soul into funding public goods as a co-founder of Gitcoin. Over that time, we’ve seen projects like Dune Analytics, Ethers.js, Snapshot, Uniswap, WalletConnect, Yearn, and of course Plasma Group (now Optimism) reach sustainability in a variety of ways that are only possible thanks to Ethereum. While I’m proud of the impact we’ve been able to have, I believe that to scale our work further it is crucial that we do more to dispel the myth that public goods aren’t profitable. Having connected with @optimistprime and others on the Optimism team so much over the years, and worked closely with them via Gitcoin, I’m confident that they will be able to help achieve this goal, both thanks to the sheer talent on their team and their broader values alignment.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the Optimistic Vision:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Public goods are often discussed as goods that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous. I submit that a better framing might be to consider public goods as goods that create positive externalities. In that framing, we can find plenty of examples of projects in Ethereum, including many DAOs, that are critical for the long term sustainability of web3. These projects should be financially rewarded such that they can not only survive, but thrive, and we now have new coordination and incentive mechanisms to ensure that happens in a way that benefits all market participants. In short, I believe in the optimistic vision for the same reason I believe in playing positive-sum games.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1. "This is a “Working” Constitution"
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Good governance means working flexibly and adjusting direction not only based on the will of the community but based on learnings that naturally happen as a DAO scales. Huge fan of this approach and especially a fan of the four year limit. Consensus &gt; immutability.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
2. "OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective."
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Love the idea of checks and balances across different decision-making bodies, and strongly agree with Vitalik here. Although DAO governance is a powerful tool, we need to be careful, just in other democratic systems, to avoid implicit or explicit plutocracy.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3. "The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model."
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I strongly agree with the idea of progressive decentralization and believe it’s only natural for Optimism to focus in on the foundation to start and slowly expand its values and goals out to the community. A DAO without direction cannot achieve its goals, and there needs to be a core group that sets the initial conditions for future direction / growth.

Not everyone needs to work on a VC-funded for-profit soul-crashing startup that gives nothing back to the world.


My view on the Optimistic Vision: In short I dig it. The main thing that pushed me to get actively involved in Gitcoin DAO was the goal of funding public goods. Only for my specific case public goods is the much more specific and hard case of opensource software. The idea of finding ways to make opensource software sustainable by providing incentives to those who build them is something that excites me and fills me with purpose.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: I find them logical. (1) Makes sense. Things will evolve. (2) Intrigued to see how the bicameral governance of checks and balances will end up working out. (3) For the 3rd article and the foundation, I wonder if the DAO gets any say on the operations of the foundation, like who sits in the board etc.?

My view on the Optimistic Vision:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I’m a strong proponent of retroactive public good funding. I participated in the first experiment as a badge-holder and engaged in conversations about taking it to the next level. I’m thrilled to take part in the next steps.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My long term vision goes beyond cyberspace. I see retroPGF as the perfect way to bring the power of the free market to make the world a better place. In particular I would like to experiment with retroPGF in the field of medical research, where the current incentive structure is broken and retroPGF could align it perfectly.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If the Optimistic Vision proves successful, I hope we can replicate the model to kickstart similar ecosystems where they’re needed the most.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is a “Working” Constitution. - Definitely agree. Just seeing how much the ideas evolved in the past year, makes it obvious how much it still needs to evolve. I’m thrilled to see what it’ll look like in four years.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective. - I think this separation is a good start but I anticipate conflicts of interest that will require a more complex system. The bicameral system is a good way to start, but I expect it’ll evolve into something we can’t quite predict yet.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model. - I understand why it’s needed for pragmatic reasons, and the foundation model works well for other projects. I hope the foundation will maintain a high level of transparency and empower the bicameral governance system whenever possible.

My view on the Optimistic Vision:

I am a strong believer of public goods, and I think that we’re just starting to see the tip of the iceberg for them within Ethereum. I am strongly aligned with the vision that Optimism has, and I believe that it will be a big deal for the world in the next few years.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Totally agree with iteration and experimentation. We are not experts in politics, but we can experiment much faster than any physical entity can. We should also strive to achieve non plutocratic on-chain governance at all costs. Having a foundation with one foot in meatspace is also critical.

I have limited time to participate in governance and for a number of reasons I believe my time will be most effectively used with the Optimism community.

I thoroughly enjoy participating in governance and learning new ways in which it can be improved. I feel very aligned with the Optimistic Vision and I believe I would be a valuable asset to the Optimism Collective.


My view on the Optimistic Vision 2: I love the analogy of building a town that focuses on community and public goods. I believe that the Web 3 community is at an inflection point, and it’s critical to build communities that bring positivity (and optimism!) into the space.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Iteration is crucial to governance. Without consistent experimentation and learning, it’s impossible to improve and move forward, which is essential to the success of any community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I find the model of the Token House and Citizens House super fascinating. This is not a governance model I have seen play out and I would love to participate.

To realise the Optimistic Vision, there must be effective collaboration between OP governance and the projects that call Optimism home.

Lyra has built a protocol, community and ecosystem on Optimism and has experienced the unique opportunities and the challenges of doing so in an Optimism native way.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
By sharing these learnings, I can help make Optimism the best place to build a Web3 project.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the Optimistic Vision 2:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The longer I spend in crypto, the more I realise it’s all about coordination. The Optimistic Vision is a bold attempt to redefine the way we coordinate that leverages the innate strengths of the internet.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One of the biggest advantages of internet software is that it can be freely replicated, making it a perfect public good. However, without a business model, we have been forced to undermine this strength with paywalls and a closed source mindset.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If retroactive public goods funding is successful, free and open-source software will be able to take centre stage as we build the next generation of the internet.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We’ve embraced iterative governance at Lyra and are strong believers in it. The important thing is to codify how the governance process itself can change (i.e. meta-governance) early on so that changes can be transparent and democratic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It’s imperative that we as a community move beyond coin voting, which suffers from being inherently plutocratic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I believe the Optimism Foundation is a necessary evil at this stage. While Lyra is strictly DAO first, we understand the scale of infrastructure projects like Optimism and the need for entities to exist in the beginning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

My view on the Optimistic Vision: We are strong believers in the Optimistic Vision. Too many open-source contributors are not getting meaningful compensation while short-term profit seekers in Web3 are getting rich. Optimism’s vision of funding public goods seems like the best way to re-align incentives and makes for a future narrative filled with hope and positivity. Moreover, Cryptotesters guild is optimism-native with its membership NFT launching in 2 weeks on Optimism mainnet.

My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:

At Latam we want to change that and insert in the best possible way all the talent that the users of our +20 Latam countries have.

Scaling Ethereum is the most important topic to global adoption, and we are willing to collaborate so that there are no barriers in this part of the world and raise our voice.

My view on the Optimistic Vision: the internet has connected all the people in the world, and now we must do the same in the Internet of value. On the other hand, systematically we have seen the problem of public goods at the government level; but, under initiatives like this, things can definitely be different and we will be there to bring our vision. I personally expect to see criticism and contributions to the optimistic view based on our experience on this side of the world.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We believe that governance will mature over time while meeting its objectives. From our perspective, we consider 4 years is a good goal to start, but would not be enough in case new technologies arrive that change the paradigms and points of view, we need to be prepared for any scenario but always pursue a consolidation at 4 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We have seen how the classic governance model is not sustainable over the time or makes it vulnerable in certain circumstances. This is critical when governance applies not only over a protocol but all a scaling solution and its protocols inside. A bicameral governance system is a first good step but we are looking to research on improving this aspect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
By now this is a mandatory step but we are looking to expand and open the different roles as soon as feasible and then have diversity in the vision of the future of the protocol.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I hope that by becoming a delegate I can help to steer the development of Optimism in the right direction and fulfill these goals.

My view on the Optimistic Vision :
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Public Goods are essential for any thriving community (virtual or not). A systemic solution to the public goods funding problem will make Optimism the best rollup to use.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The previous year, I had a pleasure to participate in the first Retroactive Public Goods Founding round done by Optimism. This gave me an opportunity to help many critical tools that lack any business model. I believe that baking public goods funding as a core principle of a rollup will be a game-changer for the quality of the whole ecosystem.

My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As a MakerDAO governance participant I know firsthand that it’s impossible to design a perfect system on the first try. We will have to experiment and iterate for years before we get the governance model right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Typical token governance with the airdrops model is broken (for everyone except yield farmers). Providing voting power to actual users of the domain seems like a good alignment and it’s quite innovative on its own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It seems like a reasonable way to bootstrap the whole thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Our view on the Optimistic Vision: Blockchain at Berkeley, as a non-profit, student organization focused on onboarding individuals into the crypto space through a technical-first value driven approach, supports the Optimistic Vision. We see the failure of our market to reward individuals based on collective impact, which we want to steer the Web3 community away from. Furthermore, we see the need for the Web3 space to scale in terms of values. The crypto space emerged due to philosophical ideals of anonymity and decentralization, and has grown to value composability, forming communities, and defining ownership. We want to see these values strengthened throughout the space, and the Optimistic Vision aligns with this by supporting public good projects that reward impact.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Our view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We are confident in the OP collective’s ability and determination to define itself. We are committed to pushing the boundaries and being experimental with OP governance for the goal of developing a well informed permanent constitution when the collective is mature. We see the need for a more rigid structure overtime - but hope to contribute greatly to the collective’s experimental years of self-determination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We believe OP’s bi-cameral system will be the force that ensures positive impact is profitable. Simple fungible token governance can create unhealthy dynamics - decisions made based on token price, consolidation of voting power, buying votes for selfish reasons, etc. Onboarding citizens who care about the success of the protocol - and not attaching a price tag to their vote - will help defend against these trends we have seen play out in other protocols. The dynamic between $OP holders and OP Citizens will create a system of checks and balances that we believe will be equilibrium of digital governance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We view progressive decentralization as a necessity in our space - and we are grateful the Optimism Foundation will oversee stewardship of the Collective in its youth. We trust as the Collective matures and decentralizes its voting power, control over Optimism will be handed over. We hope to help aid in maturing governance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Scaling Ethereum is needed if we are going to bring to life the things I am dedicated to building with Giveth and Commons Stack. I organized a Scaling Now conference and interview series in 2018 and worked with Hermez (Now Polygon Hermez a public goods focused rollup) on and off over the years. I would like to get deeper into the scaling community!

Optimism is very aligned with my values of solving Public Goods funding issues with novel economic driven win-win systems. I would like to help in any way that I can, and given that I am a Delegate for ENS and Gitcoin this seems to be the most obvious way to help. Also, I LOVE experimental governance systems and as a delegate I will get to be on the forefront of how we tune parameters as a community, and I love that stuff!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the Optimistic Vision :
“Positive impact to the collective should be rewarded with profit to the individual.”

This is exactly what I spend every waking hour working towards.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“We imagine a future in which the Collective expands beyond the digital realm and into the physical world.”

I work towards this future everyday with Giveth, bridging web3 incentive models to meatspace is the dream and we are doing it! Giveth is going straight into the physical world, but Commons Stack (as well as Gitcoin) is also taking the pragmatic approach and starting with areas that are relevant to our work (Token Engineering) and building solutions for that. I agree with starting with Public Goods in the Optimism and Ethereum space and then venturing out as we grow.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have never been as aligned with a vision of a crypto project that wasn’t one I helped to found.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
Love the humble Experimental approach, 4 years is definitely enough time to come to a steady state solution. I like the citizen approach, I couldn’t find the on-boarding or off-boarding info for Citizens, but that will be an interesting experiment, that OP has already prototyped in their first Retroactive Public Goods Funding Round.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As far as the Cayman Islands thing, that’s cool. Thats similar to the set up of ENS, but at the same time, I’m a little sad to see it cause I remember when OP launched, it was a B-corp and honestly I was really hoping they found a repeatable way for a B-corp to tokenize with delegated governance! Expectations are the root of all disappointment. I haven’t read the charter for the foundation (couldn’t find it), but hopefully its board is beholden to the decision of the governance system, otherwise the governance will be a farce, and the board are a shadow third check not stated in the design (just being real here).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Really excited to have methods to tune parameters as a delegate, I hope we have some cool dashboards to play with and take some lessons learned from other projects that do similar like mstable, TEC, 1inch, etc.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

My skills and areas of expertise:
I’ve been a contributing member of the Ethereum community since 2015 &amp; received a masters degree in Digital Currency in 2016 (first degree of any kind ever given in digital currencies).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As community manager for Slock.it and TheDAO, I helped form the community around TheDAO and led every angle of the crisis response effort following TheDAO Hack.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I co-founded the White Hat Group, which secured the at-risk funds (10% of the total supply of ETH) during TheDAO hack and one year later rescued $210 million dollars worth of crypto assets following the Parity Multisig Hack. I also audited Aragon and MakerDAO systems with the WHG.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In 2016, I co-founded Giveth, a donation platform similar to Gitcoin, we have the best donation platform in the world giveth.io where 100% of the donations go to the project and we have the web3 version of a tax-deduction where our token $GIV is given to the donors, it is a web3 public goods lego that i hope optimism can use for their own public goods funding approach (free tokens on top of your donation, why not?)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I co-founded DAppNode in early 2018 to ensure the p2p world has true hardware decentralization.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I co-founded the Commons Stack in 2019. The Commons Stack is the natural progression of Giveth’s efforts to build the future of giving from a Token Engineering perspective with a goal of creating Public Good focused economies. Our first Commons, the Token Engineering Commons, launched earlier this year and we did a lot of interesting community parameterization.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I also co-founded a project still in stealth mode called General Magic which is a sort of a Service DAO like Raid Guild but focused on supporting Impact DAOs.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have contributed to dozens of other projects as well, most notably, iden3, Hermez, and brightID and continue to support all 3 in an advisory capacity. Hermez (now Polygon Hermez) is especially relevant as it is also a public goods focused rollup.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I also lead 2 crypto focused burning man camps, Decentral and Blockhaus ;) Look me up if you want to burn with THE crypto camp on playa.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My favorite Web3 projects:
Grassroots Economics, Panvala, 1hive&lt;br&gt;

I have worked significantly with Fuel Labs, contributed to the native bridges of both Optimism and Arbitrum, and have been working with Lito Coen and the L222 team to bring liquidity mining incentives to Ethereum rollups.

I’m very interested in further contributing to the L2 ecosystem by helping guide Optimism’s governance moving forward.
Furthermore, I am a founder of CryptoStats, a public-goods project that will be deploying on Optimism within the coming weeks, and I believe the interests of CryptoStats and Optimism are heavily alligned.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the Optimistic Vision:

I was inspired by last week’s Bankless episode, outlining the Optimism Collective and the path forward for this project. Specifically, I believe project that are mission driven (such as Optimism with their mission to fund public goods) will allow for growth that extends beyond pre-existing use-cases.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution

Strongly agree. Decentralized governance still has a long way to go to becoming mature, and there is a need to be open to changing and experimenting
Agreed, very excited to see this experiment in expanding governance beyond the plutocracy of coin-voting, while still maintining a fungable token
Agreed, the foundation model has worked well for other web3 projects</p></div><div class="delegateCard__container "><div class="delegateCard__header"><img alt="user icon" class="icon" src="https://gov.optimism.io/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/jacob/90/359_2.png"><div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;"><h3>Jacob</h3><p class="delegateCard__description">jacob.willemsma.eth</p></div></div><p class="delegateCard__description">I believe that Optimism is good for Ethereum and am a strong believer in the use of L2 networks to further democratize access to the ideals provided by Ethereum.

Additionally, I’ve contributed to Public Goods personally with my time and talents at ETHGlobal, which was a fortunate recipient in Optimism’s first retroactive grants round 1 and have a first-hand understanding of operating a Public Good.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I’m thrilled to see that Optimism embraces both Ethereum and Public Goods with open arms and is building out its Optimistic vision around these topics. As both topics are the focus of my time and energy, I’d be honoured to participate in this process as a delegate.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the Optimistic Vision:
I love the axiom of impact=profit and have seen ETHGlobal grow from a small team running a couple of events to dozens of yearly events and a team of nearly 15. There’s an incredible positive feedback cycle I’ve observed between either side of the equality—impact increases profit, and profit can be reinvested to produce additional impact.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It’s very easy to be (and remain) pessimistic about the future but optimism is the currency of progress. I believe the vision laid out by Optimism will play a part in creating a better future for humanity.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the USA over the last month or so, regardless of position on the issue, we’ve seen the instability that can be caused by an immutable constitution. Web3 + Ethereum is still in its infancy and it seems only natural to me that we should adopt a commitment to flexibility and experimentation. I look forward to building a more long-term constitution from the learnings over a long period.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I’m excited to see how this model will play out and adapt over time. Checks and balances are fundamental to ensure a calibrated system.
I think the Optimism Foundation should look to the Ethereum Foundation as an example of how to be a great steward like this. I believe it’s necessary for any community to start with an initial strong vision and leadership, as the Collective will grow, naturally, leaders in specific topics of the ecosystem will emerge, leading to a more decentralized, constantly growing, Collective.

My view on the Optimistic Vision: 1. Really great team (the guys are super OGs working with Vitalik for YEARS) 2. The OP approach makes sense - to create an L2 (rollup) that is as close to Ethereum L1 as possible. Also to keep the changes to geth node under 1k lines of code. Less code = less opportunity for bugs. Very elegant approach. Using heavily tested infrastructure as geth = less bugs.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This is a working constitution : Completely appreciate it is a work in progress and that the community will amend multiple things; this is very exciting and hope my experience can be helpful
OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective : Incentives must be aligned. Getting this balance right will be tricky to pull off and very intrigued on the initial end product and then the improvements based on actual feedback.
The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model : As a Maker OG, I am a big believe in foundations and am supportive of and of the view that the Optimism Foundation will act in the best interest of the ecosystem.

I have seen too many public goods fall or end up hostage to their providers and compromise. We are in a critical state of our society where the vision needs to be shifted, valuable things and money are not the same and this rule should be applied when considering public goods. I want to help identify and promote these value creators so they can positively impact our future and profit from it.


My view on the Optimistic Vision: I believe this is the first step to abandoning the old nation-state system for a more global, inclusive, and sophisticated society. The Optimism Collective will seed new education systems. Open, disinterested, and nonpolitical associated media that will inform curated facts and not only manipulated opinions. New digital ways to rapidly identify problems and the most impactful solutions and more! I always felt my optimism squeezed by corporations without personal profit. This vision is a paradigm shift and we will see more and more talent attracted to it, we all want to do good and live from it.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:

My opinion is we won’t see a permanent bedrock constitution in 4 years. We will see an adaptive, flowing, and always changing code, guarded by a new collective. We live in constant change, the constitution needs to be born, live, die, and decompose to nurture the next constitution. In 4 years a new constitution will be set for the next 4 years and so on. When society makes 2 steps ahead usually also tends to consolidate power, which leads to stagnation and crisis. In a futile attempt to maintain the consolidated power usually those in power take society 1 step backward. If we want to always move forward, power consolidation must always be avoided.</p></div><div class="delegateCard__container "><div class="delegateCard__header"><img alt="user icon" class="icon" src="https://gov.optimism.io/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/danielesalatti/90/218_2.png"><div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;"><h3>Daniele Salatti</h3><p class="delegateCard__description">salatti.eth</p></div></div><p class="delegateCard__description">I want to be an active participant in a project that I believe can have a seriously net positive impact on society as a whole.

Public goods are something we all benefit from, still they constantly underfunded. I think an approach that makes public goods profitable - while keeping them community owned - is the only sustainable way to go.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Completely agree that experimentation is the best way to understand and figure out what the best approach and structure is for all aspect of the collective. I am not sure that we will ever have a “Bedrock Constitution” if that means “set in stone” or “that is never changed”. I believe constitutions to be living documents that need to adapt to the changes of society over time - and I believe this to be true for DAOs as for countries.

We believe that Optimism represents an important public good within the Ethereum ecosystem and as such, must be governed in a careful and considered manner. Wildfire and :fire:_​:fire: have made thoughtful and effective contributions to many governance systems including ENS and Gitcoin. We are excited to bring this context and experience to OP governance.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the Optimistic Vision:
Wholeheartedly agree. The OP vision is the vision of Ethereum; fostering a layer two ecosystem which is value-aligned with Ethereum and the ethos of public goods is of utmost importance. Wildfire believes that Optimism is the L2 which has both the technical and directional capacity to provide the much needed scalability to the Web3 community.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1. "This is a “Working” Constitution"
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Wildfire believes that taking the first step of governance by establishing a working constitution is not just prudent, but necessary. Good governance requires flexibility and forethought, especially when it comes to a nascent space such as ours.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A commitment to experimentation also means a commitment to improvement, and we at Wildfire agree wholeheartedly with this approach.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Finally, the four-year limit on the working constitution also demonstrates a thoughtful beginning for the Collective, by enabling a regular review of decision-making power and how it flows in the Optimism Collective. Wildfire fully concurs.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
2. "OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective."
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If Optimism Collective wants to accomplish the task of retroactively funding public goods and driving sustainable growth in the decentralized ecosystem, it is critical that its government does not become a tokenized plutocracy.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We strongly support the fact that Optimism has proposed a governance model that aims for equality and for putting checks and balances in place for the different bodies involved in decision making. :fire:_​:fire: and Wildfire are excited to play a roll in both sides of the Optimism Collective.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3. "The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model."
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At Wildfire, we are confident that the Optimism Foundation will protect the interests of the ecosystem when it has to be involved in decision making.

同意。我们正处于协议治理和公益资金混合的前沿阵地。我们应该对实验持开放态度，并试图找到一个良好的平衡点来向前推进。
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Agree. Having both OP holders and citizen governance design is an effective way to balance the short-term interest and long-term development. A similar design in ENS governance shows an effective result when there’re turbulence occurs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
同意。同时拥有OP 代币持有人和公民治理设计是平衡短期利益和长期发展的有效方式。当发生人事动荡时，在 ENS 治理中的类似设计显示了有效的结果。

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the Optimistic Vision:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We see public goods funding, and more generally the manifestation of selfish incentives through human-controlled power structures, as the root issues which cause many of the symptoms seen in modern society. Blockchains and similar decentralized technologies enable the redirection of human incentives in a way that no technology has enabled in the past. We must capture this opportunity to reinvent society for the better, and ensure that the technology does not fall into use for evil.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The initial governance period will be highly dynamic. Progression towards a stable system is natural and necessary for long-term governance. We would like to see and/or contribute to a more fleshed-out definition of what “bedrock” constitution means, as we do not believe four years will be quite enough for a stable governance system to emerge. (This period covers only a single Bitcoin halving cycle: from a macro perspective, we cannot hope to capture all cyclical effects on society in just four years.)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We believe in progressive decentralization as the path forward in web3. We are hopeful that blockchains and similar technologies will lead to a fairer and more equitable system for all, and we are eager to contribute our efforts to that future.

We want to participate in this experiment and help design an infrastructure that rewards public goods because we know from first-hand experience how tough it is to build them.

My view on the Optimistic Vision: We’d like to discuss here three key ideas found in the interpretation section of the Working Constitution, as these guiding principles are key to the Optimistic Vision. First, we fully agree with the necessity of minimizing governance. I think a better framework to use here is to clearly define the tasks and decisions pertinent to each level of the Optimism governance structure. Avoiding governance fatigue means only bringing the most important decisions to the community. For this reason, we fully support the delegate system.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Second, fixing the current plutocratic state of governance is trickier than it seems. There is a clear gap between the current dominant idea that token voting sucks and the reality of blockchain governance where an immense majority of projects still use token voting. Achieving a balance between financial stake and humanhood is a complex issue, but we strongly believe that the Optimism Collective has one of the best chances at solving this issue - which is why we’re applying to be delegates.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Finally, we strongly believe in the necessity of funding public goods. For the first year of its existence, Snapshot survived from donations - Gitcoin, and a few generous projects such as Balancer or Curve. If it wasn’t for their generosity, Snapshot wouldn’t exist today. During that time, most of the biggest web3 projects were already using it. We are 100% committed to helping new public good projects grow and serve the ecosystem, and we strongly believe we’ll benefit significantly from that cultural shift.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: Adding to what’s written in the first article, it’s necessary to innovate in terms of blockchain governance. The clock is ticking in terms of planet-wide coordination problems and the insights we can gain here have the power to change that. We have a moral duty to be pioneers of a system where looking out for one another is rewarded, and doesn’t come at an economic cost.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the second article, I’d like to add that conflict is the default state of any democracy. Conflict is good, it’s a sign that dialog is possible and encouraged. It should be fostered, and key to the economic and ethical health of the governance structure.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Finally, the third article is a necessary measure and we believe that, as the first article states, this is something we’ll be able to discuss more in-depth once the Optimism Collective has found its footing and is ready to decentralize these responsibilities.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

My skills and areas of expertise: Designing governance systems and implementing them.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My favorite Web3 projects: Gitcoin, Balancer, Open Zeppelin</p></div><div class="delegateCard__container "><div class="delegateCard__header"><img alt="user icon" class="icon" src="https://gov.optimism.io/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/minimalgravitas/90/155_2.png"><div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;"><h3>MinimalGravitas</h3><p class="delegateCard__description">MinimalGravitas.ETH</p></div></div><p class="delegateCard__description">While I’ve been playing with Ethereum since 2016 it was only in 2019-20 that I really started to ‘get’ the potential of it as a coordination tool. Then in quick succession (not sure which was first) I read a Bankless article on Moloch (and then the Slate Star Codex article that it references) and the book Ministry for The Future, in which one of the key components in saving the biosphere from global warming is a complete overhaul of the financial world through a crypto currency called Carbon Coin. Great book, go read it.

From that point on this idea that Ethereum was just an interesting tech project to learn about or a valuable investment seemed almost quaint. I’ve been enthralled by projects like Gitcoin, Klima, and now Optimism. The concept of Ethereum’s Phoenix, using the incentive structures of retroactive public goods funding to encourage behaviours with positive externalities seems completely revolutionary, it might well be what we need to overcome the Great Filter of climate change that we are barreling towards, and even if it’s not then it will almost certainly be the Schelling point around which the people who do develop even better mechanisms converge. I want to be as involved as I can.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the Optimistic Vision : We have seen in the legacy world that relying on charity and altruism is not sufficient to tackle the biggest problems we face as a species. By flipping the incentives to reward actions that contribute to public goods the Optimistic Vision changes the game from one where freeloading and exploiting the commons benefits the individual more than the shared community cost effects them, to a system where finding the ways to produce the most positive effect with your capital will end up being the most financially rewarding choice.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting with public goods in Optimism and the broader Ethereum ecosystem is like ensuring your own oxygen mask and your family’s are fitted first when an aircraft cabin loses pressure. In the long run though, my optimistic view is that we get to the cabin and take over from the unconscious pilot in time to avoid crashing to a fiery doom.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: Articles 1 and 3 seem almost obvious at this stage of the collective. The first for exactly the reasons described in the constitution document itself and the third as a necessity for any governance organization in it’s infancy. It is entirely understandable that the roles taken on by the Foundation are not feasible to be managed by the Token and Citizen houses initially. It seems unlikely that the undefined ‘Take other actions that are conducive to its stewardship role’ will be exploited to, for example, buy Ben Jones a yacht…!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Article 2 is or course the most exciting part of the Optimism Collective’s Working Constitution. I am extremely interested to see how the creation of Citizens will take place and how Sybil resistance will be maintained, however the idea of having part of the governance control based on permanent members with long term incentives, rather than having all the power effectively purchasable through token trading is very appealing. I think that it is becoming increasingly well recognized that airdropped token governance is inadequate on it’s own. It is good to reward active participants in a project, but when many (most) airdrops get sold and governance power is then available to whoever can pay for it it is inevitable that we will recreate the plutocracy of the legacy world. By balancing this with OP citizens, issued with a single soulbound voting token the possibility for long term decision making seems much improved.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


My skills and areas of expertise:My main educational background is in physics and astrophysics, with a side of environmental decision making. While the specifics of planetary atmospheres and deceleration of spacecraft isn’t directly useful to crypto governance, the general skills of objective analysis and investigating problems that are beyond the current frontier of human knowledge seems to have a lot of crossover with what we’re building and discovering in this new field of coordination structures.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As a secondary interest I have worked on projects trying to understand and improve community resistance to manipulation in Web 2, assisting investigative journalists analysing Russian influence campaigns, constructing the ‘Web of Lies’ map of Cambridge Analytica’s spin-offs, funders, clients etc and building the Trollfare wiki of research on disinformation. If you check my Twitter you will see almost nothing crypto related – for that my social media of choice is Reddit, usually trying to answer questions and correct misunderstandings in r/ethereum and learning from the wise minds in r/ethfinance.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My favorite Web3 projects: 
Curve (for the 90’s style UI), Sign In With Ethereum (can’t wait for it to be the norm online), and GreenPill (what do you mean a podcast and a Telegram group isn’t Web 3…).</p></div><div class="delegateCard__container "><div class="delegateCard__header"><img alt="user icon" class="icon" src="https://gov.optimism.io/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/devonzuegel/90/230_2.png"><div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;"><h3>Devon Zuegel</h3><p class="delegateCard__description">devonzuegel.eth</p></div></div><p class="delegateCard__description">I find the underlying values of web3 and crypto incredibly compelling, especially as articulated by the people in the Optimism community, and I have been following crypto closely ever since the Ethereum whitepaper came out in 2014. It seems obvious that (a) trustless computation and (b) a public, trustless, immutable database are revolutionary primitives that will unlock amazing things we haven’t seen before.

And yet, I’m generally skeptical of most web3 so far, because the vast majority are self-referential; most excitement for crypto products is predicated on the appreciation of crypto itself, rather on something that people value independently from crypto. I’ve been following this space for 8 years, and I’ve yet to see an application that isn’t deeply “meta”. As cool as many of those are, what I really want to see is web3-style solutions tackling existing problems we have in the world. I think this is possible, but I just haven’t seen much of it yet.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So with all that, my interest in participating in Optimism is that I’d like to do my part to shepherd the community towards more of those concrete applications that will change the way people live and relate to each other. I’m optimistic we can make it happen. :slight_smile:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the Optimistic Vision: It’s incredibly exciting to find a community that values public goods as much as I do, and understands that coordination problems are central to almost every major problem that humans have struggled most to solve.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I’m curious to see what concrete steps the Optimism community takes to actual solve these sorts of problems. It’s easy to point out that coordination problems are the source of many of our troubles, and it’s a different thing entirely to actually execute on novel solutions to solve those problems.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: I’m excited to be part of the evolution of this governance system, and that it’s intentionally designed to be flexible, responsive, and iterative. In the same spirit, if I’m elected as a delegate, I plan to start with a self-imposed term limit of 3 months. After that, I’ll reflect on whether I feel like I’m making a meaningful contribution to the ecosystem and decide whether I should continue being a delegate.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

We’re a decentralised derivates exchange and one of the leading protocols that currently operates on Optimism. We’re a big believer in composability and have been actively bringing partner projects over to deploy on OP. Having committed to making OP our home, we’d love to be an $OP delegate to help shape the future of Optimism.

My view on the Optimistic Vision 1:
Completely agree that we need to create a space that is owned by its citizens rather than a select few. The focus on composability excites us on the future of the space and it’s something we can’t wait to see play out
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is a working constitution : Agree. This is a very similar approach that we take at Perp as we believe in the need to continually learn and improve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective : Agree on this view. It’s extremely important that we place emphasis on the balance - too often projects skew either side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model : We understand that there needs to be some entity to start with to help facilitate governance and push things forward. Given there isn’t a strong blueprint for the best way to decentralise (without trading off speed of execution) the plan to gradually decentralise makes the most sense
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My favorite Web3 projects : Big fan of Ribbon and Frax</p></div><div class="delegateCard__container "><div class="delegateCard__header"><img alt="user icon" class="icon" src="https://gov.optimism.io/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/opuser/90/179_2.png"><div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;"><h3>L222</h3><p class="delegateCard__description">hailvitalik.eth</p></div></div><p class="delegateCard__description">I want to be blunt about one thing, I started exploring OP ecosystem because of possible airdrop and was excited when I was part of it but after going through the whole announcement, I stumbled upon the idea of a new governance model. The idea of The Optimistic Vision and bicameral governance system changed my opinion on how I used to look at a project.

This is what was missing from the web3 space, an idea of giving power to the users, not just the token holder but everyone. You can be a builder, contributor, community member and working toward building a better digital and web3 space. An idea to make public good profitable with retroactive incentives. This digital space is moving quite fast, from Vitalik’s whitepaper in 2013 to roll-ups and zkp in just 8 year, we have come a long way, from Bitcoin P2P idea to smart contract to metaverse to digital identity but we don’t see any impact of this movement in physical world. With public good, we can change this.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With my application to be a part of delegate community, I want to part of this movement, work together, provide feedback, seek guidance and the same time guiding and offering help. This is movement where a project can be more than just a token and I want to make it happen. Sure, we might fall at first, but iteratively, we learn, and we will succeed.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If I have to say this in one line, I would like quote Vitalik’s opinion on this Governance model as I totally agree with him “Possibly the biggest attempt at non-token-holder-centric DAO governance so far. Excited to see where this goes.”
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the Optimistic Vision: This is one of its of its kind approach to incentive users on the basis of fairness ratio, where public good leading to incentives which in turn going to impact whole web3 space. There was a need to bridge the gap between crypto and physical world, and I believe “Optimistic Vision” can be that bridge.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is a working constitution : “A commitment to experimentation”, this is what really motivates me, and I agree with this. Grow and evolve by doing experiment, iteratively.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective : This is yet to be seen, sounds good on paper but implementation can be challenging. Finding the balance between short-term incentives with its long-term vision would be a difficult task but again this a governance model of its kind, we need to see if we can do this with OP holder and OP Citizens. Four year is a long time in digital fast-moving space, and I am OPtimistic about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model : Yes, I agree with this, at this early stage some steering is necessary. Although, in long I would like to see a self-governing decentralized OP Foundation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

My favorite Web3 projects: Decentraland, Metamask, Curve</p></div><div class="delegateCard__container "><div class="delegateCard__header"><img alt="user icon" class="icon" src="https://gov.optimism.io/user_avatar/gov.optimism.io/danelund.eth/90/174_2.png"><div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;"><h3>Dane Lund</h3><p class="delegateCard__description">danelund.eth</p></div></div><p class="delegateCard__description">I am the Head DAO Architect at Alliance DAO. Alliance DAO is a community of builders that is focused on supporting Web3 founders individually and collectively succeed. Alliance believes that Optimism is building a foundation for Web3 projects that need the functionality of EVM without the gas intensity. Among many reasons for wanting to participate in Optimism’s governance, three reasons motivate me to apply: (1) Optimism is building core infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem; (2) Optimism will be increasingly important for Alliance founders; and (3) Optimism will play an important role in helping DAOs govern increasingly large pools of capital. I believe that by directing capital to support public goods in the Optimism and Ethereum communities will generate significant value to these three causes.

We believe Optimism will provide long-term value to the Ethereum ecosystem. Optimism’s focus on EVM equivalence and minimalism enable projects to access the core functions of Ethereum with high fidelity and low friction while reducing the gas intensity of operating directly on mainnet. The coming release of Bedrock represents the culmination of years of experience and trial-and-error that we believe will give developers even greater confidence to build on Optimism. Secure, battle-tested L2s are a gateway through which Web3 innovations will thrive.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Optimism is a scaling solution for a number of projects that have graduated from our accelerator, including Synthetix and Perpetual Protocol. We believe Optimism will be an L2 of choice for many future cohort participants, given the demand for EVM equivalence and the ease of integration via Optimism. I aim to represent the views of our founders and cohort companies who have a vested interest in Optimism’s reliability and improvement.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I believe we are approaching a point where L2 solutions will be critical to DAO function, specifically. As we see more experimentation with governance, we need an EVM equivalent L2 that reduces the transaction cost of governance. Delegated hierarchies, subdaos, and pods present exciting opportunities to augment governance systems, but the pace and quality of experimentation will be suboptimal unless DAOs build governance on L2, thereby minimizing gas costs. Optimism is a prime candidate for enabling better governance for DAOs.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
By participating in the governance of the Optimism Collective, I aim to be a steward of the mission to direct funding to public goods that benefit builders in the Ethereum and Optimism communities in furtherance of the three purposes I listed.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the Optimistic Vision : We believe that incentives drive outcomes. Web3 projects have created more tangible incentives for actions and relationships that were previously difficult to quantify. Optimism’s view that impact=profit is an extension of our view that well-engineered, traceable incentives create optimal value for collective activities.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ownership and rewards are the most reliable way to attract talented builders to address problems that affect the collective. While there are noble examples of altruists who create public goods, altruism is not reliably abundant, and it is most often an individual trait rather than a trait of teams. Web3 building requires focused teams, and ownership and rewards offer predictable incentives that can guide teams to increase the common good.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Optimism’s vision touches on a matter of necessity. Web3 needs communities that strive to create incentives to build public goods. There are many Web3 participants who seek to extract rents and game systems for profit to the detriment of the community. Optimism’s vision is a rallying point for capable builders to push against short-termism, thereby ensuring that over the long run, value will compound for the entire community.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Article 1: At Alliance, we emphasize that the greatest systems start simple. To create a rigid model of governance without the benefit of incremental feedback on specific governing rules is to govern in a vacuum. In my constant review of DAO governance systems, I see that the most successful communities adopt minimal procedural principles and adopt specific rules as specific needs arise.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I often speak with Alliance cohort companies of the importance of experimentation in improving governance throughout Web3. The results of the experiments need to be intelligible in order to provide appropriate feedback. If the results of governance experiments are documented and made broadly available, the record of the experiments are, themselves, public goods. Optimism and other DAOs can study each others’ governance trials to consider how prospective rules could affect their own communities.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As we learn more about how rules function with specific communities, we need to permit those communities to adapt to their reality and adopt the rules that best suit them. For that reason, it is important that the Constitution is focused on flexibility. We should only adopt enough order to initiate a worthwhile experiment, while limiting the potential downsides of path dependence.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
By virtue of the commitment to experimentation, it follows that the Constitution should be transitory at inception. We may discover sound methods of governing that are unimaginable to us at the moment, which would make dogmatic reference to the original document unproductive. An example of governance innovations that had no application in the recent past is Optimism’s adoption of soulbound tokens for the Citizens House. We may discover incredible utility from using soulbound tokens that, had a governing document conflicted with the adoption of those tokens, would have stunted the development of the governance system.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The goal of creating a Bedrock Constitution is helpful: at some point governance history may require documentation of foundational rules. The Bedrock Constitution should incorporate the principle of flexibility and the capacity for amendment in order to sustain the spirit of innovation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Article 2 : Basic token-weighted governance has not proven to work for collectives. I have studied DAOs that are purportedly flat in structure and repeatedly these DAOs show gulf in participation between a small number of repeat-participants and the mass of inactive participants. Without balance of power, a few actors grab power, which alienates most would-be contributors.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Optimism’s bicameral structure is a compelling way to balance short term needs with long term, stable decision making. Variants of the bicameral model worked for Rome (Senate / Tribunes), Sparta (ephors / gerousia) and for many constitutional structures in modern government.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is too early to assess whether the specific reserved powers for the Citizens’ House and Token House will provide sufficient controls. Experimentation will provide feedback that will help inform which powers should be reserved to which house.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Article 3: I am very familiar with Cayman Foundation Companies, as I have researched the option for Alliance DAO and for other DAOs. I believe that structures like the Cayman Foundation, which permit significant flexibility in organizational design, are a stepping stone, but not an end state, in building successful DAOs.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If the Optimism Foundation faithfully administers the vision of progressive decentralization, it will have fulfilled a critical function for the Optimism ecosystem. As drafted (presumably in the Memorandum of Association), the Board’s powers present an additional dimension of separation of powers. The Foundation can have a stabilizing effect if the initial allocation of powers between the Citizens’ House and Token House is not perfectly balanced. Over time, it should be made clear what powers the Citizens’ House and Token House have relative to the Foundation and whether the Foundation will have the ultimate goal of sharing the power to amend the Constitution or ceding the power altogether.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

My skills and areas of expertise: I was trained as a corporate governance attorney. I left the practice of law to become an investment banker, then an investor, on my way to becoming an entrepreneur. Through my path, I gained a wide variety of organizational experience. Now, I focus my time both on DAO design and helping Web3 founders think through complex issues in tackling their product roadmaps at Alliance. I speak to founders of DAOs, protocols, and Web3 tools on a daily basis about the problems they face and I act as a thought partner to work with them to find long term solutions.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have been an active participant in public policy and governance policy discussions. I testified to the Wyoming state legislature regarding amendments to their DAO LLC statute; I participate in DeFi Education Fund projects; I am part of the World Economic Forum DAO Working Group; and I participate regularly in conference panels on DAOs. I have a passion for governance design and am fortunate to have made it my daily work.

Consequently, I started blockchain-comparison.com to spread quality information and onboard people to crypto. Now, I want to take this one step further with scaleweb3.com, defend the most value-aligned, value-adding, essential Web 3 building blocks and help them grow.

Sidenote: Personally, I see Ethereum as the center and settlement layer of Web 3 and Optimism as a fundamental building block in our envisioned Web 3 stack. The Ethereum ecosystem has quality contributors, some positive-sum, value-aligned projects such as Uniswap and Gitcoin and I would love to become a governance steward that further supports the values with best interests of projects and token/stakeholders in mind.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the Optimistic Vision : I see many parallels to our own ambitions when we started 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About us - Blockchain-Comparison.com in 2018. I also love to make the (somewhat flawed) comparison between blockchain ecosystems and new economies and think it’s essential to find key parties early-on which are able to unlock network effects, a sustainable growth of the ecosystem - based on real economic growth - with aligned values (!). Besides that, I was positively surprised to see “impact = profit” as almost all social/public goods should at least be sustainable and I am all in into proving that public goods can capture margins and be positive sum for all value-adding OR benefitting, consuming stakeholders.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: The title is spot-on. You don’t build a complex system from scratch, you rather go there iteratively. I believe in progressive decentralization, think it’s absolutely fair for a core team to take the majority of key decisions early-on but I will definitely work towards a future with core protocols which are hardened, secure, trust-minimized, governance-minimized, yet community-owned.

But, like so many others, I felt frustrated by the slow adoption of these projects. In being a delegate I see another hands-on opportunity to grow the success of the ecosystem—in this case by helping guide Optimism protocol decisions. As the founder and owner of several technology businesses I understand the importance of having a strong advisory board, which I would consider myself part of for Optimism. One of my businesses is also a PoS validator operator, so I am already familiar with the responsibility of being delegated tokens and voting responsibly on behalf of my delegators.

My view on the Optimistic Vision: I believe the invention of blockchain technology and web3 will be one of the most important milestones in human technological progress. But only if the citizens of our young and fragile community can steer the technology into the right direction and keep it ahead of profit-driven corporations and bad actors. The Optimistic Vision lays out one such approach, and I would be honored to help guide the Optimism community into the right direction.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: As someone already working to transform a relatively new DAO with 5,000 members into a truly decentralized organization, I am well aware of the need to iterate collective governance. It takes a steady hand at the steering wheel until the organization has learned to steer itself, and the Optimism Foundation’s role and leadership is critical until true decentralization is reached.

We’re Blockchain@Hopkins (@blockchain_jhu on Twitter), the student blockchain club at Johns Hopkins University for all of our schools (undergraduate, graduate, business, even medical!). We’re currently a group of over 100 members, with a core unit focused exclusively on contributing to protocols in the form of governance, development, and white-hat.

As a student-run club, we take decentralized governance very seriously and think of ways to be a crypto-native as possible. Via our governance team, we’re piloting an internal governance token, built on Polygon, which is an attempt to provide our club members and university students globally with a chance to learn, and contribute to our own club and manage our treasury and consequently fund public goods that contribute to the club such as educational courses, events, hackathons, outside development, white-hat, etc. By actively contributing to the club mission, members earn the erc-20 governance token, which gives club members voting authority on the treasury allocation and more. One of our main focus areas (both in research teams and in practice via our development team) has been projects such as Gitcoin. We are excited to further this interest by contributing to the OP Ecosystem both from a policy perspective and a technical one.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Our (planned) Optimism governance committee is composed of 2 Cryptography PhD Students (focused on rollup technologies), The 3 other students major in Computer Science, Economics, Sociology and International Relations. The governance committee works very closely with the research team to analyze emerging trends in DAOs and tokenomics. We are also advised by Prof. Matthew Green, Ph.D. (part of the founding team of Zcash) and Prof. Jim Liew (Prof of Finance and Cryptocurrencies)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is imperative that in order for the Collective to be equitable and democratic, it needs to be inhabited by people from a diverse background that possess general proficiency about the strengths and limitations of web3 technologies and have the passion and drive to actually participate in the governance process. We believe that – for reasons we already elucidated – our student body is fit to advance the Collective to that direction.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the Optimistic Vision:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
First and foremost, we love OP’s idea of retroactive incentives. While retroactive incentives with clear and definite deployment are rare in a worldly context, in the context of the information age, we agree that retroactive incentives can be implemented fairly, using blockchain and other web3 technologies.
We also believe that the Collective is well-equipped to accomplish this task of deploying capital for public goods, in an ideal democracy. That’s why a lot of us got into blockchains – To participate in a more perfect meritocracy with impact aligned profit.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We are encouraged by the nature of the Constitution being elastic. As we were piloting our token, one of the most important things we had to do is iteratively work on not only the guiding principles but also the tokenomics and implementation of agreed-upon proposals. As OP’s collectively growing, we think it’s important to be flexible.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The bicameral structure of OP’s governance is one of the most interesting experiments in the blockchain governance space to date. Assuming that there is a proper accountability practice in place, adding an additional ‘house’ that isn’t bound by the market condition of the governance token is surely going to align with the longer term goal of the Collective. We are excited and optimistic (heh) to see it come to fruition.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We love that the eventual goal for the foundation is to be decentralized. We believe that while it might be easier to strategically start with a more centralized model (as we initially started), we are true believers that at scale, decentralization is fundamental.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I have spent a few years learning and interacting with the EVM and have witnessed and participated in many DAO’s. I truly have a deep love for Ethereum and its values and would like to make a contribution in helping build a Collective Optimism. It’s fantastic to even have this opportunity to participate in such an amazing adventure.

My view on the Optimistic Vision:
With this new governance structure, it will be interesting to witness how the retroactive funding for public goods allows Optimism to grow and in turn how it can empower Ethereum to flourish. Being able to experiment gives Optimism more freedom and a better chance in getting a DDP (Digital Democratic Governance) to work…properly!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The main takeaway would be that Optimism shares Ethereum core values and aims to achieve complete decentralization in the future. I am intrigued by the Working Constitution in this everchanging, face-paced, environment. I feel having the right principles and philosophy, will be key to the growth of Optimism and that is what I have experienced in the Optimism eco-system. It’s a challenging road ahead balancing the Token House and the Citizens House, with a “system that will evolve as the Collective grows.”

I think the setup is conducive to a well functioning community but its hard to predict unknown unknowns. This would be a great exercise 90 days in. Personally, I lean a bit more towards users have rights than ++ test in production, but I am open minded.

We’re Penn Blockchain (@PennBlockchain on twitter), a leading, completely student run blockchain organization from The University of Pennsylvania for both our undergraduate and graduate schools. The club currently has over 50 members and we’re expecting many more in the semesters to come!


Penn Blockchain has committees covering Governance, Research, Education, Business Development, and Development/Web3. On the governance side of things, our team has different members leading governance initiatives for different protocols we have delegations for. Current Penn Blockchain delegations include Aave, Compound, Uniswap, DyDx, IndexCoop, Maker, etc. Each week, governance leads will share updates with the club about new proposals and we will all debate about what to do before voting with our wallet.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

We’d love to be your $OP delegate as many of us have been closely following Optimism for a while now. Our weekly discussions combine graduates with years of expertise in many jurisdictions with many bright minded undergrads eager to leave their impact and names in Web3.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

My view on the Optimistic Vision:
“Together, we will create the future of coordinated, collaborative cyberspace.” We couldn’t have put it better ourselves. The ushering in of a new digital democratic governance used to drive rapid and sustained growth is one that resonates well with us, and something we entirely support!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:

This is a working constitution: We like the introductory period before the constitution becomes the Bedrock Constitution. As with most novel things, we will have to change and amend multiple things; this allows us to do just that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective: We are in support of the bicameral governance system. As stated, short-term incentives and long term visions must be aligned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model: We understand that the Optimism Foundation will at times have to step in. We expect, as well as are confident, that the Optimism Foundation will act in the best interest of the ecosystem.</p></div><div class="delegateCard__container "><div class="delegateCard__header"><img alt="user icon" class="icon" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACAAAAAgCAYAAABzenr0AAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAALFJREFUWEdjPBgw5T8DEmgra0TmUp1d1VWPYibjqAMGPATcj4mipAFCkY4eh+jqSU1DjKMOGPAQIJQIv36/jRLNrZOX4E0m1bkxKPLcnKoofJLLgVEH0DwE0BMhuoXocUionECXJ2QeRjlASMOoA6geAjZ7P6DUBYTinNK6AD2KGUcdMOAhQKgyQo9zQvU9qeoJtgdINZBU9aMOwAgBUoOQUMFEyLxRB4yGwGgIDHgIAAD/uf918tK90AAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="><div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;"><h3>Matthew Bunday</h3><p class="delegateCard__description">zencephalon.eth</p></div></div><p class="delegateCard__description">I felt very impressed when I saw the governance structure that Optimism intends to setup and the care that went into the initial airdrop claim selection process.

I also work as an engineer at PleasrDAO and would love to see NFT activity moving on L2s in order to spread adoption to larger audiences.

My view on the Optimistic Vision : It feels extremely important to me to continue showing the world that public goods can create profit for all stakeholders. I believe Ethereum has made a great start and would love to see Optimism carry that forward and onboard the next billion users.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: I appreciate the framing of the constitution as a working document, love the basic two house structure, and agree with anti-plutocrary as a guiding function. Governance minimization also seems wise to me.

I really appreciate how Optimism is using technology for positive social impact, putting purpose and not just profit front and center and fostering public goods development for the long term benefit of everyone. This is refreshing and equally reassuring at this point in the crypto adoption cycle.

I’ve contributed to MakerDAO’s mission since 2018, being part of the Foundation team and now (after being part of the Foundations dissolution) a contributor to the DAO on the Maker Growth Core Unit. I believe it’s incredibly important that everyone has the optionality into DeFi. Affordable and secure transactions are key to bring decentralized services to people everywhere.This is why I want to participate in Optimism.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the Optimistic Vision:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Building public goods funding and creation into the mechanism design of Optimism and by default Ethereum, gives us the best chance to create a system that inherently gives back to its users in a net positive way. Intentionality creates positive momentum and incentives help keep that momentum. I’m all for reshaping behavior in this area!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is an honest and realistic design approach. New models need time to be tested and emerge from theory to practice. It’s not easy stuff.
Having two key focus areas to orient action and decision making seems like a logical way to avoid distractions and minimize inefficiencies.
Like anything in its infancy, having guidance from a Foundation and dedicated “caretakers” is crucial to create the right frameworks for the Collective to operate in and eventually become self-sustaining (“fly from the’'nest”)

That said, I don’t think it is guaranteed. This is an experimental form of governance which needs strong execution in order for the vision to be realized. I would like to aid in the realization of this vision, and I believe that my broad background (Product Management, Machine Learning, Economics/Game Theory, Communication &amp; Finance) makes me well-suited to the task of guiding the Optimism Collective while communicating to my delegators at each step.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the Optimistic Vision :
The Optimistic Vision is important because it’s a guide to introduce positive externalities into the incentive systems of a community. “Impact = Profit”. By retroactively rewarding those who create public goods, we make the “good” decision the rational one. This is an amazing concept, and The Optimism Collective combined with RPGF is the best chance humanity has had so far to make it work. Let’s summon that phoenix. :triumph: :heart_on_fire:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
1: This is such a novel coordination experiment, that I don’t think there is any other way than to have a “working” constitution. I’m looking forward to the experimentation of The Optimism Collective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
2: I also believe that both are necessary, but I think there are other ways to describe this than just “short term incentives vs long term vision”. The Token House is the home of economic incentives and The Citizen’s House is the home of community incentives (positive externalities).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3: I accept the necessity of this article, and I am confident in the current members of the Optimism Foundation based on their record.

We want to become Optimism delegates, because we believe Layer 2s, and specifically Optimism, are a core piece to scaling the new digital economy on top of Ethereum.

Flipside Governance participates in more than a dozen protocols across Ethereum, Solana, Algorand, Flow, and a number of Cosmos SDK chains. We work closely with Aave, SushiSwap, Marinade, and MakerDAO - and have on-chain proof of participation. We aim to bring our expertise and one of the few full-time Governance teams in the industry to help Optimism strengthen its governance and voting processes.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As a delegate, Optimism gains full access to our time and resources, a team of 70+ with robust data science &amp; infrastructure capabilities, and our community of 12,000+ data analysts.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
On top of that, we will contribute hands-on expertise in voting, writing, and passing proposals. We are active community members in protocols that we engage with - you can find us actively participating on governance forums, Discord, and Twitter.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Our view on the Optimistic Vision:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Through our analytical bounty and scavenger programs, Flipside Crypto embodies the axiom impact=profit. Flipside Community members take the time and initiative to build out dashboards and analytics, providing unique insights for a range of protocols &amp; DAOs.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Flipside believes that public goods inform and empower the average crypto user better than closed source alternatives. Optimism is pioneering this vision and advocating for profitability at the same time. We want to help Optimism follow through on its vision and improve Web3 accountability, one build at a time.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Our view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Article 1: Every DAO experiences different Growth trajectories. As partners of DAOs in different stages of maturity and TVL, we believe it is important to allow for flexibility while building with speed. Enough structure to support, as much freedom as possible, is our guiding principle.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Article 2: While token holders are entitled to certain rights, they are not what makes up a DAO by themselves - Governance comes in many forms and is in need of innovation. Optimism must find a balance between value creation and encouraging participation among community members. We acknowledge multiple assets exist to make up a DAO and are excited by the experimental use of emerging new mechanisms, like “soulbound” NFTs.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Article 3: As Compound has shown, and as we have seen in our work with MakerDAO, there is a way for organizations to become more decentralized over time. We believe that having the Optimism Foundation as a steward in the early stages of development is instrumental, as the Foundation can provide the insight and knowledge necessary for building a strong product that can then enable successful decentralization.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Our skills and areas of expertise:

Flipside is a Web3 company with experience in building tools, communities, and recently DAOs. We partner with major networks &amp; protocols to drive data analytics and user acquisition.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Flipside Governance, a department of Flipside Crypto, was established in September 2021, to directly support and contribute to DAO governance, and increase participation in our partner communities - thereby helping to improve the efficiency of this critical piece of protocol health.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We are committed to using this team and experience to improve DAOs one proposal at a time.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Flipside Governance is one of the few full-time governance teams in the industry. We have developed a deep understanding of the needs and of the flow of information in governance processes as well as key tooling necessary to be successful.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Our annual conference, Ledgerfest, focused on crypto and web3 founders from Arbitrum, Polygon, Cosmos, Drift, Audius, and more! We host weekly speakers like Aave’s Founder Stani, Nansen’s Founder Alex, Optimism’s own Kelvin Fichter and we host weekly technical blockchain and development workshops.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This spring we organized a 3-day hackathon, Lionhack for students and other builders in the space to help onboard more people to crypto and incubate new projects in the space. We are strong supporters of innovative Defi projects, and we are big believers in what the future of OP Governance and the Optimism collective might become. Given our experience in our own DAO’s governance as well as in Uniswap, Compound, and dYdX, we believe that we are strongly equipped to act as a neutral and effective governance delegate for Optimistic Governance!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the Optimistic Vision: We all know that one of the founding principals of Web-3 is proof-of-work, and proving yourself through impact and results have been a core principal of crypto communities since Bitcoin’s beginnings. But we believe the Optimistic collective is taking the proof of work idea to the next level with digital democratic governance. We believe in a world where incentives align and digital citizens can be rewarded contributing to the public good. We also believe in the continuous struggle toward self improvement, something the Optimism Collective has highlighted as a goal in its Vision.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We believe in the search for continuous improvement. The optimistic collective and vision will evolve over time and the world will look different in four years.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We’re excited about the experimentation between $OP governance and OP citizenship.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We believe fewer and fewer foundation intervention is better for the Optimism Collective in the long run.

Accepting and committing to working hard to ensure that we can further develop it in the right direction
Agree. The duality of the system is yet another part of Optimism Collective that makes me excited about its future. I am excited about implementing a sybil resistant system in which we create a Citizen’s House that consist from actually caring participants &amp; cannot be manipulated the same way the coin voting is being manipulated today.
I agree and hope that Optimism Foundation will be the entity that doesn’t let us diverge from the mission. In my opinion, many web3 projects are quick to pursue the full decentralisation at a cost of innovation, speed of action action and integrity. While as a delegate ill be representing views of people that trusted me, i also believe that Optimism team deserves &amp; earned their trust especially for the first few years to come

I am a strong believer in the importance of funding public goods and was quite active contributing to Gitcoin back in 2020. The Optimistic Vision represents a massive step forward in Ethereum’s commitment to public goods and I’m very excited to see it come to life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It represents a refreshingly candid view on web3 governance - we don’t expect to get it right from the beginning and instead begin the journey with an open mind, ready to experiment. Balancer has been through a few experiments of its own and even recently created their new Foundation in the Caymans so I will bring relevant and constructive insights as Optimism starts this journey towards a governance system that truly serves the interests of the Collective.

It has been a delight watching the community form and the network grow across every metric. As a delegate, I promise to represent fellow Optimism builders, users, and believers in Ethereum. I tell pretty much whoever will listen that rollups are broadband for blockchains and that they will change the world. As a delegate, I can help make this a reality and play a small role in scaling Ethereum to the masses.


My view on the Optimistic Vision:
The most important line in the vision is, “The Optimism Collective will dispel the myth that public goods cannot be profitable.” Hindsight is 20/20, and for the first time, we can use it to our advantage to allocate capital (and potentially other resources) to public goods! When I first learned about public goods theory in an Economics class, the professor spoke of their unprofitably and underfunded nature as a given. I want the Collective to prove them wrong!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I think RPGF presents a new paradigm for human coordination. Today it directs funding to web3 devs who built useful tools, but tomorrow it can and will do so much more.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:

The transitory nature is good. In four years we will have a MUCH better idea of what effective governance looks like for crypto networks. I have always encouraged L2s to experiment (previously in development but now in governance) and am happy there is a commitment to it.
This is ambitious but I have nothing but praise. I am genuinely excited for the first Holder vs. Citizen conflict and think the Collective will come out of it stronger.
In my view this early level of control is necessary. I only ask that the Foundation maintain a rigorous internal process for treasury allocation and publish some sort of regular transparency report. I do not think the Foundation should ever be arbitrarily forced to dissolve. It should remain a steward and driving force for ecosystem growth and will naturally be made redundant by other actors.

We’ve worked with projects like Compound, dYdX, and Uniswap on several high-impact initiatives (e.g., DeFi Education Fund, running an auction process to hire an auditor for Compound, and the dYdX Grants Program. As part of our work, Reverie is an active voter in the governance processes of projects we’re involved with. We believe great projects need great governance. Our motivation to be a delegate is simple: we care about governance, are excited about Optimism, and as a result, want to be involved in the governance process!

My view on the Optimistic Vision 11: For better or worse, the easiest way to get great people to do great things in a capitalist system is to pay them. As a general matter, we’re very aligned with the idea that (i) money is a thing that can be used to get great people to do great stuff, (ii) the more money (profits) you have, the more great people you can get and the more great stuff you can do, and (iii) public goods can generate a profit, and that profit can be re-invested into more public goods (read: great people). It won’t all be rosy (there are plenty of private, rent-seeking actors masquerading as public goods entities), but with the right people sitting at the “profit allocation table,” we believe the goal is an achievable one.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: We think it’s fair to say we don’t know exactly what Optimism will look like in three to five years. As a result, we don’t think it makes sense to have rigid rules around governance — a rigid constitution around a fluid and emergent technology/community would significantly slow the growth of the ecosystem. To that end, we really like the idea of fluid governance.

My view on the Optimistic Vision :
Our foundation here at Optimism is strong and our vision strongly aligns with the major principals and beliefs that most Ethereum maximalists adhere to, I think optimisms culture is comparable to Gitcoin and in the end that will benefit the protocol.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting out governance is always a slow and painful process so i completely agree with the approach as naturally things start to smooth out with time. however i would like to see a way to amend such a Constitutional law if it is somehow detrimental to the protocol no matter the timeframe. keep in mind this would need to be extremely thought out.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Clearly checks and balances are needed, people voice also should always matter so a include all approach is great considering our users not only know what we need but also drive the ship, i strongly agree.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I trust the Optimism Foundation to nurture the protocol until it can care for itself, it would be foolish to say otherwise. This not only protects users but protects the protocol from various exploits.

These are very attractive to me.
The governance of many projects on the market at present is not interesting and there is no sense of participation in the knot, and only a small number of people are willing to participate in the governance. So there is a need for agents to emerge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Becoming an agent can deeply participate in the op ecology and can help the community more deeply.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

My view on the Optimistic Vision: Many of the so-called public chains in the market are centralized. They are not only decentralized, they also abandon the original value of Eth network. op sticks to its claim (not abandoning the value of Eth, decentralization). I agree with OP’s proposition.
op’s governance is novel and future-proof. op introduces and concept of meta-universe governance, which will make community governance more interesting and give community members a sense of participation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Agree with the first point.&lt;br&gt;
A governance model that can be used as an industry standard has not yet emerged. So we need a dynamic governance logic that can change with the tide.
Strongly agree.&lt;br&gt;
OP Citizens and OP Holders are mutually constrained to make governance dynamic and balanced, and OP Citizens makes governance more interesting and participatory.&lt;br&gt;
strongly agree.&lt;br&gt;
The existence of Optimism Foundation is an important player in the beginning of OP governance and can make OP more compliant. As time goes by, the decentralized governance logic will become more mature, and the Optimism Foundation’s authority will be decentralized at that time. That’s great.&lt;br&gt;

I do believe that public goods funding is the only long run sustainable model, but given my experience in the space I think it is HIGHLY likely that this is a means through which connected parties will heap cash on their buddies, while allowing those who are not well-connected to whither on the vine. Nothing would give me greater satisfaction that exposing this sort of behavior publicly so that righteous Eth values can prosper. I want to summon the proverbial phoenix as much as anyone, however, I have seen many cases in the past where appeals to idealism are simply used to mask outright theft from end users.

My view on the Optimistic Vision : Fundamentally I think this is the right idea, however, it is absolutely begging to be abused by unscrupulous grifters, as we have seen in so-called decentralized governance up to this point. If delegates fall victim to group-think or are concerned about harmony rather than moral principles, I think this experiment will be a colossal failure. Delegates must be willing to risk being very unpopular in order to do what is right, and without such delegates this is going to be a massive handout to anyone unscrupulous enough to exploit it and a constituency apathetic enough to allow it to happen.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution: Decentralized governance has yet to be solved, so I think a commitment to experimentation is warranted. Having a bicameral legislature is a very good start, but in my opinion not good enough. I am concerned that the foundation has far too wide a berth. I really, really don’t want to see another DeFi Education Fund.

We fundamentally believe that blockchain technology will shape our future financial and governance structures, and as such it’s crucial that those building these systems are representative of the global, diverse population which they intend to serve.

As users (old and new) are priced out of Ethereum Layer 1, we urgently support Optimism’s mission to scale Ethereum sustainably and are firm supporters in the creation of a virtuous cycle of public goods funding to benefit users both financially and through user experience of the cyberspace.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We support the Collective’s axiom of impact=profit and the principle that positive externalities should be rewarded with profit to the individual. We intent to use our delegation to ensure the individuals rewarded make up the global, diverse population that exists today and welcome them to the cyberspace through the work achieved by the Optimism Collective.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We know, based on numerous studies, that diversity within organizations boosts innovation and acts as a driver for increased profitability. So, by encouraging more diverse participation in Optimism by delegating to she256, Optimism is structurally cementing an environment ripe to produce more innovative products and superior financial returns.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We believe we can be neutral governance participants who will represent the values and interests of our allies and underrepresented folks in crypto, as well as the Optimism Collective itself. By delegating to us, you’ll be an ally to our cause. Thank you!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the Optimistic Vision:
We support the Collective’s axiom of impact=profit and the principle that positive externalities should be rewarded with profit to the individual. We want to align this to our vision by using our delegation to ensure the individuals rewarded make up the global, diverse population that exists today and welcome them to the cyberspace through the work achieved by the Optimism Collective.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We support the funding of public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem. Lack of public goods funding in the physical world often perpetuates inequalities, especially for underrepresented members of society. We align wholeheartedly with the statement that public goods can in fact be profitable, because democratizing access to resources has ripple effects in reducing inequality and as a result, generating profit. We aim to represent our communities of allies and underrepresented folks of crypto and believe we can assist the Collective in this goal. We would welcome the opportunity to contribute and play a directional role in building a virtuous cycle of impact driven expansion which benefits all users of the ecosystem (both existing and potential) both financially and via user experience which aligns closely she256’s core mission.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As we fundamentally believe in blockchain technology shaping our future governance structures, we support the Working Constitution’s commitment to experimentation and flexibility and would welcome the opportunity to play an active role in building the playbook for fair, democratic decentralized governance. Impossible to master on the first try, governance requires commitment to rapid experimentation / adaptation ensures a healthy system where incentives remain aligned.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We support the Optimism’s model to move away from simple token-based governance systems which tend towards consolidated power amongst the wealthy “whales” of our ecosystem. This experiment to build a voting system representative of a large diverse community, regardless of token balance, aligns closely with she256’s core mission. As the Optimism Collective continues to experiment with governance structures, we welcome the opportunity to help hold the Collective accountable in avoiding excessive consolidation of power and aligning incentives for all members of our society as this is a key component of our voting philosophy.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We believe in progressive decentralization and welcome the Optimism Foundation as early leaders in the Optimism Collective’s governance model. We request the transparency in actions and decision-making of the Foundation and look forward to the guidance and unique insight that the Foundation can provide.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Zooming out, we believe the ability to clearly and concisely communicate information, as done in the Working Constitution itself, is a healthy indication of well-organized and sustainable governance.

The application ecosystem on Ethereum was raw and practically unusable then, but we’ve seen the beginnings of broad societal reach now.

It is evident that scaling Ethereum with a community-aligned effort is critical today. Optimism is widely accepted as the most EVM equivalent optimistic rollup and any decisions made (eg. retroactive distributions, grants, protocol changes, decentralization of sequencer) need careful consideration from delegates who care deeply about their short and long term tradeoffs.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I co-founded Spectral, which creates a score for users based on historical user activity (specifically with lending and trading protocols currently). Our goal is to encourage users to care about their actions on-chain and be good actors, while allowing protocols to be more capital efficient and user-sensitive. I’ve also helped build, incubate and made critical protocol decisions with several projects in the space that include: a widely used AMM, a decentralized basis trading protocol and a payments management tool for projects. Not too long ago, I was working towards a PhD in computer science focused on applications of zk-proofs before deciding to build in web3 full-time.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In order to onboard every person on Earth eventually, we will need scaling solutions to be governed thoughtfully with a long term future in mind. I believe active governance over Optimism will lead to a community that fosters values which promote public goods with strong incentive alignment for contributors. I want to be part of this active governance and deliver value to the Optimism and Ethereum ecosystems simultaneously.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the Optimistic Vision 3:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Growing up seeing Wikipedia ask for donations every few months in order to keep operating was jarring given the impact Wikipedia has had on the world. On the other hand, we’ve seen time and time again, with platforms like facebook, that the mandate of generating profit for shareholders skews incentives in a way where users and platform contributors are no longer the main beneficiaries. In the long run, the societal impact of primarily profit-seeking platforms has been largely negative.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the face of all this, Ethereum has been an incredible demonstration of the premise that Impact = Profit. While it was not clear initially that ETH would accrue value, by attracting millions of developers and users who built open-sourced applications and tools considered public goods, the holders of ETH greatly benefited from a community formed around shared beliefs.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Optimism ecosystem is in a particularly challenging position, where given the EVM-equivalence, most public goods built for/on Ethereum can benefit Optimism and vice-versa. As a scaling solution to Ethereum, it is important to balance value accrual towards OP and ETH so that the ecosystems are symbiotic in the long run.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“The Optimism Collective will dispel the myth that public goods cannot be profitable”. This is a statement I am fundamentally aligned with. Optimism has the opportunity to carefully craft incentive structures around distributing OP and rewarding public goods given a large percentage of these incentives across User Airdrops, RetroPGF and Ecosystem Fund have not been distributed yet.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My view on the first three articles of the [Working Constitution]:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Working constitution:
A commitment to experimentation - Creativity and experimentation seem to have stalled a bit in the space, especially in regard to economic incentives for contributors. The deluge of liquidity mining incentives and retroactive airdrops have led to very predictable project trajectories that often don’t accomplish the goals of the project. I would like to see experiments and improvements on Quadratic voting, soulbound NFTs and using cryptographic tools to enhance private voting. I would also want to see more tools being built around self-sovereign identity as public goods, leveraging a lot of the recent work from the zero-knowledge community.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective:
Will have to see how things play out. Every project has large idealistic goals and dreams but often times economic incentives overrule everything else. Both houses need to be designed with this in mind, to allow for sustainable growth.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model:
A normal starting point. With progressive decentralization of all aspects of the Optimism ecosystem, it remains to be seen how Foundations can remain at once hands-off (in allowing creativity and freedom while not picking “winners”) and nurturing (in providing specific support) to contributors.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

StableNode also provides a full suite of services around governance with both implementation and active participation as a delegate.

The Governance Lab of the StableNode team is on a mission to provide decentralized governance best practices to ecosystems. There is no one-size-fits-all solution but a framework of principles and tools that articulate alternative paths based on each ecosystem’s maturity level. Our primary focus is working with the community to develop this framework and continue to facilitate innovation within this domain.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Our view on the Optimistic Vision:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At StableNode, we believe that public funding is essential to developing a non-financial-driven web3. We believe that the focus should be on encouraging developers to take a different approach to web3 and focus more on public goods where a lot of development is made. Even though public goods are necessary to the space, there is a lack of funding, making it a less attractive role for developers.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Initially, the blockchain space was born out of a need to change the current financial and political standards that we have. The Optimistic vision details a necessary future and sets a new standard for public funding that is sustainable and will encourage new developers to focus on this field while not sacrificing the financial gain they would gain elsewhere.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Our view on the first three articles of the Working Constitution:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is a “Working” Constitution.
Currently, we are in the exploration stage of governance, and it is refreshing to see a protocol acknowledge this and encourage continuous experimentation throughout the next few years.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Decentralized governance is relatively a new field within Web3. It is an important topic that we need to continue working on. Many problems such as voting mechanisms, delegate incentives, and plutocracy need to be tackled. We believe that the best way to succeed is to practically try new governance methods in protocols and understand what is successful or detrimental to a protocols governance framework. The theory is essential, but it can only get you so far. We are excited to be a delegate for a protocol that prioritizes experimentation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
OP Citizens and OP Holders will equally coexist within the Collective.
This experimentation hopes to tackle problems such as misaligned incentives through token holders or plutocracy. Such issues are prominent in the space and allow token holders to prioritize their financial gains over long-term improvement. With the citizen house maintaining control over the retroactive public funding it realigns incentives in a more fruitful manner.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Those individuals from the token house might be against public funding as this means reduced financial gains for themselves, but those from the citizen house who have no financial incentives for OP would want to see the space move forward and see those actors developing public goods be compensated fairly.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Optimism Foundation will be a steward of the Optimism Collective and its early governance model.
We favor the foundation initially leading the governance front while the framework and structure of the OP governance are being built. With token holders and delegates initially not having a financial incentive to contribute, it is most likely that progress would be slower without a foundation. Over time as the structure and framework are built, as mentioned in the working collective, it would be expected that the foundation would slowly release the responsibilities to the DAO.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Our skills and areas of expertise: Governance and Growth
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We are currently delegates at Element Finance, InstadApp, MakerDAO, and others.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What voters can expect from StableNode:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We will use our expertise to import the most promising practices within governance to guide Optimism governance to a more sustainable approach.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We want to help facilitate discussions where we can identify the best practices and recognize how to tackle core problems within governance such as plutocracy, voter apathy, and lack of experimentation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As delegates, we pursue:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Active participation in votes&lt;br&gt;
Transparency for each vote&lt;br&gt;
Open discussion and contribution to the DAO forum&lt;br&gt;
Contribute to the innovation and development of governance frameworks&lt;br&gt;
Conflicts of Interest&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

StableNode acts as delegates on other protocols. All of our governance participation is public.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="delegates__sideContainer"><div class="delegatesSidebar__container"><div class="delegatesSidebar__votingPower"><h2>Voting Power</h2><div class="amount"><span></span> <img alt="op logo" src="/static/media/op-logo.45a8f652a908db9e4cce.webp"> </div><div class="delegatesSidebar__selectionContainer"><div class="empty">You haven't selected any delegate yet</div><div class="delegatesWrapper"></div></div><button class="optimism-button__container   undefined">Connect</button></div><ul class="delegatesSidebar__faqs"><li class="accordion__container"><button class="button">What is delegation? <svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="chevron-down" class="svg-inline--fa fa-chevron-down icon " role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 448 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M224 416c-8.188 0-16.38-3.125-22.62-9.375l-192-192c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.75 0-45.25s32.75-12.5 45.25 0L224 338.8l169.4-169.4c12.5-12.5 32.75-12.5 45.25 0s12.5 32.75 0 45.25l-192 192C240.4 412.9 232.2 416 224 416z"></path></svg></button><div class="accordion__answerWrapper" style="height: 0px;"><div class="answer">Participating in governance of the Optimism Token House will require a serious time commitment.
